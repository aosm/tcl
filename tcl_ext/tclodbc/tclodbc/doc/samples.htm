<H1>Utilities and sample programs</H1>
<P>While working with tclodbc I
have created numerous small utility procedures and programs for
different purposes. These programs usually are quick non-general
hacks, as scripts often tend to be. Thus most of them do not have any
value as general utilities. </P> 
<P>However, I have had some requests
for more comprehesive examples of tclodbc programming. For this
purpose I have included in tclodbc 2.1 some utility programs as well
as some example programs that take use of them. The samples include
e.g. creating, dumping and loading of a simple MS Access database, some
date/time conversion functions and sql code generating utilities.
Also, an of example of using tkTable widget with tclodbc is also
provided.</P> 
<H1>Important note from author</H1>
<P>tclodbc as whole is provided on an "as is" basis, without any warranties
whatsoever. This concerns the utility and sample programs as well as
the extension itself. Utility programs are especially small and
simple, and most propaby won’t work with every platform or dbms.
Therefore I am not very interested in receiving e-mail about bugs or
fixes in the utility programs. If they are of help to the users,
good, if they are not, that’s how it is. Anyway, they are naturally written in
tcl and may provide some insight for using tclodbc and also a good template
for writing your own utilities. The bug reports of the actual extension
are naturally still welcome and very much appreciated.</P>
<H2>Sample programs</H2>
<P>The sample programs are copied in directory <I>samples</I> below the tclodbc installation
directory. Most of the programs are best run in plain tclsh, except
tktable.tcl, which should be run in wish. The sample programs include
basic documentation in the form of tcl comments.</P>
<H2>Utility procedures</H2>
<P>Utility procedures are
included in several tcl files that are copied to tclodbc installation
directory. The procedures are sourced in namespace ::tclodbc when
running setup.tcl. So the utilities are normally called with
namespace suffix. Example:</p> 
<P><FONT FACE="Courier">tclodbc::SqlShell db</FONT></P>

<P>Because of the use of namespaces in packaging, tcl 8.0 is required
with the utilities</P>

<P>The utilities are documented in some level in accompanying <a href="utilref.htm">utilref.htm</a></P>
