<H1>Cheater's Guide to Writing AppleEvent Descriptors</H1>

<HR>

<P>
Until I found out about <A 
HREF="http://www.westcodesoft.com/FTPOCTools.html">Capture AE</A> (thanks 
Tom!), there was no simple way to figure out how to write an 
<CODE>AEDesc</CODE> for some applications (I've never learned anything 
useful from <A HREF="http://www.ravensoftware.com/">AETracker</A>, but 
YMMV). Determining something as trivial as a list of the available disks 
which, in AppleScript, is
</P>

<PRE>
	<B>tell</B> application "Finder" <B>to get</B> disks
</PRE>

<P>
can be an unholy nightmare to translate into AEGizmos. Note that in recent 
versions of Tcl there's no need for this particular AppleEvent, because 
the same result is obtained with <CODE>[file volumes]</CODE>, but it serves 
as a nice example. When we wanted to implement <CODE>[file volumes]</CODE> in 
Alpha 7, which uses the Tcl 7.5 library, this is exactly the process we 
went through.
</P>

<P>
If you activate <A 
HREF="http://www.westcodesoft.com/FTPOCTools.html">Capture AE</A>, 
execution of this AppleScript dumps
</P>

<PRE>
	Process("Finder").SendAE "core,getd,'----':obj {form:indx, want:type(cdis), seld:abso(«616C6C20»), from:'null'()}"
</PRE>

<P>
This is easily enough rendered with TclÆ as
</P>

<PRE>
	tclAE::send -r 'MACS' core getd ---- {obj {form:indx, want:type(cdis), seld:abso(«616C6C20»), from:'null'()}}
</PRE>

<P>
Although it works, "<CODE>abso(«616C6C20»)</CODE>" isn't very 
nice to look at.  A quick pass with <CODE>tclAE::coerce::hexd&gt;TEXT</CODE> 
(or perusal of an ASCII chart) reveals this is, reasonably enough, the 
identifier <CODE>'all '</CODE>. We make this substitution and send it, and 
call <CODE>tclAE::print</CODE> on the resulting descriptor hash key,
which… unfortunately… returns
</P>

<PRE>
	aevt\ansr{
		'----':[
			obj {
				want:type(prop), 
				from:'null'(), 
				form:prop, 
				seld:type(sdsk)
			}, 
			obj {
				want:type(cdis), 
				from:'null'(), 
				form:name, 
				seld:“catbert”
			}, 
			obj {
				want:type(cdis), 
				from:'null'(), 
				form:name, 
				seld:“ratbert”
			}
		]
	}
</PRE>

<P>
which is a parsing nightmare (it's not even usually formatted this nicely). 
Note that, on top of everything else, the Startup Disk is treated 
differently from everything else. Fortunately, we can make the Finder do 
our work for us by using the <CODE>'rtyp'</CODE> tag. We now send
</P>

<PRE>
	tclAE::build::resultData 'MACS' core getd rtyp TEXT ---- {obj {form:indx, want:type(cdis), seld:abso('all '), from:'null'()}}
</PRE>

<P>
which yields a manageable
</P>

<PRE>
	catbert: dogbert: ratbert:
</PRE>

<P>
on my computer.
</P>

<H2><CODE>'aete'</CODE> Resources</H2>

<P>
Even with Capture AE, it's handy to be able to read <CODE>'aete'</CODE> 
resources (if for no other reason, to decipher what you just blindly copied 
into your TclÆ statements). Resourcerer has a template to open 
<CODE>'aete'</CODE> resources and you can decompile them with Rez. If you 
can manage to find it, Yuji Hachiya of Apple Japan wrote an 
<CODE>'aete'</CODE> editor for ResEdit. It would appear, though, that Apple 
has hired the Mossad to hunt down and destroy every copy of this utility 
(I’ve seen complaints about it, but it's perfectly adequate for 
<EM>reading</EM> <CODE>'aete'</CODE> resources).
</P>

<H2>Desperate Measures</H2>

<P>
If, for some reason, <A 
HREF="http://www.westcodesoft.com/FTPOCTools.html">Capture AE</A> is 
unavailable to you (redistribution is prohibited, so <A
HREF="http://www.westcodesoft.com/">WestCodeSoft</A> could 
conceivably withdraw it), there is, fortunately, a trick you can try:
</P>

<OL>
    <LI>Enter your desired AppleScript in the Script Editor, but trick it 
    talking to Alpha instead of the actual target application<SUP><A
    HREF="#ReallyDesperate">*</A></SUP>. For instance,
	
<PRE>
	<B>tell application</B> "Alpha"
		<B>using terms from</B> application "Finder"
			<B>get</B> disks
		<B>end using terms from</B>
	<B>end tell</B>	
</PRE>	
    
	<LI>Return to Alpha (or Wish) and write a dummy Tcl routine to 
	intercept this event, such as
	
<PRE>
	proc snoop {theAESubDesc theReplyAE} {
		return [tclAE::print $theAESubDesc]
	}
</PRE>

    It needn’t do any more than this.
    
    <LI>Declare <CODE>snoop</CODE> as an AppleEvent handler for the event you 
    wish to examine:
			
<PRE>
	tclAE::installEventHandler core getd snoop
</PRE>

	<LI>Open the Result window and run your script. You should get something 
	like:
    
<PRE>
	"core\\getd{'----':obj {form:indx, want:type(cdis), seld:abso(«616C6C20»), from:'null'()}, &amp;inte:cans, &amp;timo:3600}"
</PRE>
    
</OL>


<P>
Although this probably seems like a lot of work, I assure you that 
it's far preferable to the hunt-and-peck alternative. There's no 
reason that this methodology won't work with other scriptable 
applications, either, but I take no responsibility for the implosion 
of your monitor.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ReallyDesperate"><EM>Really</EM> desperate measures</A></H3>

<P>
If you’re using a version of AppleScript earlier than 1.4, you won’t have 
access to the <CODE><B>using terms from</B></CODE> construct. In that 
event, you can try something really sleazy: 
</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Enter the AppleScript you want to decipher in the Script Editor and 
	save it as a compiled script. For example
	
<PRE>
	<B>tell application</B> "Finder" <B>to get</B> disks
</PRE>	
	
	<LI>Open the script in a resource editor, open the <CODE>'scpt'</CODE> 
	resources, and open what will likely be the only <CODE>'scpt'</CODE> 
	resource there (if you have a <CODE>'scpt'</CODE> resource editor 
	template installed, you'll want to be sure to open the resource as 
	hexadecimal).
	
	<LI>Look for the first occurence of the string <CODE>'MACS'</CODE> 
	(<CODE>4D414353</CODE>) and change this to <CODE>'ALFA'</CODE> 
	(<CODE>414C4641</CODE>) [or <CODE>'WIsH'</CODE> 
	(<CODE>57497348</CODE>)]. Ignore any explicit references to "Finder"; 
	they don't matter. You've just changed the script to ask Alpha for a 
	list of all disks. Alpha obviously doesn't know how to do this, but 
	that's not the point.
	
    <LI>Close and save your changes and reopen the script in the Script 
    editor. It should now look like

<PRE>
	<B>tell application</B> "Alpha" <B>to get every</B> «class cdis»
</PRE>	
	
	<LI>Proceed as above with writing a <CODE>core getd</CODE> handler in 
	Alpha or Wish.

</OL>

<P>
You can’t just write 
</P>
<PRE>
	<B>tell application</B> "Alpha" <B>to get</B> disks
</PRE>	
<P>
because it won't compile, and if you knew enough to write <CODE>«class 
cdis»</CODE>, you probably wouldn't need the rest of this. We've 
tricked the Script Editor into thinking that Alpha understands the 
<CODE><B>get</B> disks</CODE> command.
