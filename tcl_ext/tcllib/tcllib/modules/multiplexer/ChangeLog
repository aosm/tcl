	* multiplexer.man: This package is can be used with Tcl
	* pkgIndex.tcl:    8.2. Documented as such.

	* multiplexer.test: One test uses the 8.3'ism 'file
	  channels'. Added constraint and skipping it when under Tcl
	  8.2. Changed initialization code to ensure that the local
	  multiplexer package is loaded, and not an installed one.

	* multiplexer.man: Cleaned up the documentation of the three hooks
	  which can be set per multiplexer instance (access, data, exit).

	* multiplexer.tcl: Made sendtoorigin a true boolean flag, instead
	  of just 0/1.

	* multiplexer.tcl (NewClient): Added access denied debug message
	for accessfilter.

	* multiplexer.man: Minor cleanups.

	* multiplexer.test: Added several tests.

	* multiplexer.tcl: Adding updated multiplexer to tcllib.  It is
	now possible to run multiple multiplexer instances, and it uses
	the logger package for logging.

	* multiplexer.man: New file, still needs cleaning up.  Content
	taken from old multiplexer.n.

	* multiplexer.test: Added a few initial tests.  Working on more.
