	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* subserv.tcl (muserv): Propagate the auto_path into the
	  subprocess so that it is able to find all packages the server
	  might require. Without that the server will need an installed
	  tcllib, for example. This fixes a hang in the pop3 testsuite
	  when tcllib is not installed.

2003-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* New module. 
	* First contents are support for sub-processes in testsuites.
