	  used by the test is found even if the build directory is outside
	  of the tcllib directory hierarchy. Original patch provided by Larry

	  my configuration too.

	* base64.tcl: Frink 2.2 run, fixed dubious code.

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net

	* base64.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink.

2001-06-02  Miguel Sofer  <mig@utdt.edu>

	* base64.tcl: Greatly increased speed, obtained by: using lists
	  instead of arrays, splitting the input with [binary scan],
	  taking the bytes to be encoded three at a time, and
	  reformulating the decoding algorithm to be purely
	  arithmetic. Improved backwards compatibility, now runs with
	  Tcl8.0.

	  Nudged version to 2.2

2000-10-11  Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* base64.tcl: Fixed bug in base64::decode where trailing
	bytes were not always decoded correctly (!).  This only
	shows up with low-valued characters (less than 0x10) near
	the end of a string that was padded with =

	Nudged version to 2.1 so we can distinquish this version
	that has bug fixes and new features.

2000-10-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* base64.tcl: Extending base64::encode to accept optional
	arguments ?-maxlen maxlen? and ?-wrapchar wrapchar?, to control
	the line wrapping and the character(s) used to cause the
	wrapping.  Based on work by Joel Saunier.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* base64.test: Adapted tests to work in tcllib test framework.

2000-03-04  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* base64.test: Added tests for decoding data that was padded with ='s

	* base64.tcl: Fixed a bug with line wrapping in the encoder -- it
	was not properly counting the number of characters emitted, so it 
	was not wrapping when it should.  Changed the chars/line to 60, so 
	the output would be identical to that produced by GNU uuecode 4.2,
	for easy testing purposes.  Fixed a bug in the decoder with
	newlines -- it was not ignoring them as it should according to RFC
	2045.
	Fixed a bug in decoder dealing with data that was padded with ='s.
	

	* base64.test: Some rudimentary tests for the encoder/decoder.

2000-03-02  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: added pkgIndex file.
