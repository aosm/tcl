	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6 ========================
	* 

2004-02-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tree.test: Sorted some dict responses for reliable comparison.

2004-01-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* matrix.man: Documented method links.

	* matrix.test: Updated test to cover for method links.
	* matrix.tcl: Changed the code to determine the list of available
	  methods automatically for use in the error message when an
	  unknown method is called.

	* matrix.test:
	* matrix.tcl: Namespaces of objects now standalone, and not inside
	  of struct::matrix anymore. Arbitrary placement of objects is now
	  possible, including nested namespaces. Cleanup of all references
	  to instance variables.

	* matrix.tcl: Made the return of errors more regular.

	* matrix.tcl: Changed a number of eval calls to the more proper
	  'uplevel 1'. This means that an implementation of a method can
	  now assume that it is called on the same stack level as the
	  method itself.

2004-01-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* matrix.tcl: Typo in comments fixed.
	* matrix.tcl (__set_rect): Fixed typos in var names causing the
	  system to retain bogus cache data.

2003-12-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V1 of 'struct' added back to the tcllib codebase for backward
	  compatibility. The documentation is _not_ installed.

	* matrix.tcl:     Applied patch in file 64215 of [SF Tcllib Bug 822850].
	* pool.tcl:	  This cleans up a number of dangerous uses of [eval]   
	* prioqueue.tcl:  and makes them more robust.
	* queue.tcl:
	* record.tcl:
	* skiplist.tcl:
	* stack.tcl:

2003-07-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tree.test:	
	* tree.tcl: Reworked node attribute storage. Name of array to
	  store the information is now dissociated from the name of the
	  node. This enables the use of arbitrary node names, i.e. ':' in
	  node names. The second benefit is that nodes without attribute
	  data (normal) require less memory than before. Removed the now
	  irrelevant validation of node names and updated the testsuite.

	* tree.test:
	* tree.tcl: Changed way of mapping from tree object commands to
	  associoated namespaces. The object namespace now has the same
	  name and location of the object command. Adapted all tests to
	  account for this change.

	* tree.test:
	* tree.tcl: Changed dispatcher to auto-generate the list of tree
	  commands when a wrong one is given. Updated tests to account for
	  the now correct sort order. Changed dispatcher to uplevel 1 the
	  method execution, updated walking system to reflect this change.

2003-07-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* list.tcl: The changes in the list dispatcher required
	  corresponding changes in a number of methods: upvar/level 2 =>
	  upvar/level 1. Detected by testsuite. Bad me, should have run it
	  immediately. Bugs fixed.

	* list.test: Extended the testsuite.
	* list.tcl (lcsInvertMerge2): Fixed problem with extending the
	  result with an chunk of type unchanged, for the case that this
	  happens at the very beginning, i.e. for an empty result. This
	  fixes SF tcllib bug [765321].

2003-05-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* list.tcl (dispatcher): eval => uplevel so that upvar's in the
	  method commands do not need to know about the dispatcher frame
	  in the stack.

	* list.man:
	* list.tcl (dbJoin(Keyed)): Extended the commands with an option
	  -keys. Argument is the name of a variable to store the actual
	  list of keys into, independent of the output table. As the
	  latter may not contain all the keys, depending on how and where
	  key columns are present or not. Additionally cleanups in the use
	  of loop variables in the keyed helper commands frink complained
	  about.

2003-05-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Extension of the package functionality warrants version bump to 1.4.
	
	* list.man: Added descriptions of the db join commands, and
	  section explaining the table joins.

	* list.test: Added tests for the db join functionality. Adapted
	  existing tests to changed (fixed) error messages.

	* list.tcl: Rewrote the main dispatcher a bit to make it simpler,
	  and to allow us to hide internal functions from it. Added
	  'dbJoin(Keyed)' for relational table join (inner, lef/right/full
	  outer). Fixed function name in some error messages.

2003-05-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tree.tcl: Added some [list]'s to show node names containing
	  spaces properly in error messages.

	* tree.test: Reworked to test handling of item nodes
	  containing spaces.

	* tree.bench: Reworked, added helper procedures, testcases are now
	  simpler.

	* struct_list.man: Fixed typos in the examples.

2003-05-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tree.test: 
	* tree.tcl: allow node names with space chars and single :.
	  Double :: may be OK, but the check against it is still in.

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* prioqueue.tcl: Applied patch by author Michael Schlenker
	  <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>. Refactors internals for
	  speed. Passes the prioqueue testsuite.

2003-04-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* queue.man: Documentation fix. peek/get throw errors if more was
	  requested than in the queue. The documentation talked about
	  returning empty strings. Thanks to Michael Schlenker
	  <mic42@users.sourceforge.net> for the report.

	* prioqueue.test: Extended to check for stable insertion.
	* prioqueue.tcl (__elementcompare): Bugfix, makes insertion stable.
	* prioqueue.man: New, documentation.

	* skiplist.man: Typo fix. Thanks to Michael Schlenker
	  <mic42@users.sourceforge.net> for the report.

2003-04-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tree.bench: New file, beginnings of a benchmark suite for the
	  data structure 'struct::tree'.

2003-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tree.man: Changed name to struct_tree.man. Was in conflict with
	  tree manpage of BLT.

2003-04-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* graph.man: Switched cgraph reference to a purl supplied by the
	  cgraph author, and added wiki reference.

2003-04-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* prioqueue.tcl (__elementcompare): Failures in testsuite fixed,
	  patch provided by original author, Michael Schlenker
	  <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>.

2003-04-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* skiplist.man:
	* skiplist.tcl:
	* skiplist.test: New files. Patch #553980 submitted by Eric Melski
	  <ericm@users.sourceforge.net> on behalf of Keith Vetter.

	* prioqueue.tcl:
	* prioqueue.test: New files. Patch #607085 submitted by Michael
	  Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>.

2003-04-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tcllib_list.man: Changed name to struct_list.man. Allows for
	  usage of struct outside of tcllib, not as big a coupling.

	* graph.tcl: Redone the setting up of namespace a bit to prevent
	  problem with the generation of a master package
	  index. strcut.tcl bailed out with an error because the namespace
	  was net set up when using [pkg_mkIndex] in this directory.

2003-04-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graph.test:
	* graph.man:
	* graph.tcl: Added code to look for the C-implementation, cgraph,
	  first, and to fall back to the Tcl implementation if cgraph is
	  not present (#720348). The documentation links to the place
	  where cgraph can be had from. Note presence of cgraph when
	  executing the testsuite.

2003-04-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* list.man: Changed name to tcllib_list.man to prevent a clash
	  with tcl's manpages.

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* struct.tcl:
	* list.man:
	* matrix.man:
	* pool.man:
	* queue.man:
	* record.man:
	* stack.man:
	* tree.man:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  Set version of the package to 1.3.

	* list.cl:
	* list.test: Fixed SF tcllib bug #714209.

	* ../../../examples/struct: Added example applications for usage
	  of longestCommonSubsequence and lcsInvert.

	* list.tcl:  Added commands 'reverse', 'assign', 'flatten',
	* list.man:  'map', and 'fold' to the suite of list functions.
	* list.test: 

2003-04-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* list.man:  New files, extended list manipulation
	* list.tcl:  facilities. Started out with Kevin Kenny's
	* list.test: implementation of the algorithm to find the longest
	             common subsequence of two sequences, aka lists.
		     Added myself a method to invert a LCS into a
		     description of differences instead.

2003-04-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* record.test: Applied changes provided by Brett Schwarz
	  <schwarzkopf@users.sourceforge.net>. His comments: I had changed
	  the return when encountering a circular record; previously I
	  returned "", but now I return an error. This fixes record.test
	  to reflect the change. Part of fix for Tcllib SF Bug #709375.

	  Additional changes by myself: Reformatted (proper tcl
	  indentations). Renumbered so that all tests have unique id
	  numbers (Before all tests had id 0.1).

2003-02-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* matrix.tcl: Require Tcl 8.2 because of string map.  Use string
	map instead of regexp.

2003-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graph.man: More semantic markup, less visual one.
	* matrix.man:

	  trying to move any of them.

2002-05-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* matrix.man: Fixed typo (graph -> matrix).

	* struct.tcl: Added pool files to list of files to source.

	* pool.man: New documentation for pool based upon the original
	  HTML manpage.

	* pool.html:
	* pooltest.tcl:

2002-05-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graph.n: This file is out of sync.
	* graph.man:
	* graph.test:
	* graph.tcl: See tree, for arcs and nodes.

	* tree.n:
	* tree.test:
	* tree.tcl: Accepted FR #552972 (new methods append, lappend,
	  getall, keys, keyexists) for tree structures.

2002-04-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* matrix.tcl: Fixed SF Tcllib #532791 about unsetting of elements
	  in linked arrays as reported by Ken Jones
	  <kenj@users.sourceforge.net>. Unsetting an element in a linked
	  array now sets the corresponding cell in the matrix to the empty
	  string, and the corresponding elements in other linked arrays
	  are now unset too.

	* tree.man: New file, doctools manpage.

2002-03-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* matrix.tcl: Fixed bug #532783 reported by Ken Jones
	  <kenj@users.sourceforge.net>. Any operation adding new material
	  to a linked matrix causes a circular trace (op -> "MatTraceOut"
	  -> "MatTraceIn" -> set cell) and the inbound trace fails because
	  the data structures are not uptodate causing the range checks in
	  "set cell" to fail. Fixed by breaking the cycle. Calls to
	  "MatTraceIn" are now disabled while we are in "MatTraceOut".

2002-03-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* matrix.man: Added example of formatting a matrix using tabular
	  reports (See tcllib module "reports" too.). Fixes #530207.

2001-11-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* graph.test:
	* graph.n:
	* graph.tcl: Applied patch #483125 provided by Frank Pilhofer
	  <fp@fpx.de>. The patch adds key/value information for the whole
	  graph and extends the selection methods 'arcs' and 'nodes' to
	  allow selection based on keys and their values.

2001-10-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pkgIndex.tcl:
