	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6.1 ========================
	* 

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl:     Downgraded mime to version 1.3.6, and removed the
	* mime.man:     -decode extension from the API. This branch is for
	* pkgIndex.tcl: bugfixes only.

2004-05-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.test:
	* mime.tcl: Fixed [SF Tcllib Bug 954328]. The package mime now
	  adapts at runtime to whatever version of package md5 has been
	  loaded.

2004-05-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl (::smtp::wdata): Fixed [SF Tcllib Bug 951568]. Added
	  handlers for the query/* commands from Trf. Also changed the
	  default to sliently pass all unknowns in the future.

2004-05-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* mime.tcl (copymessageaux): Applied the patch for [SF Tcllib Bug
	  893516] on behalf of Marshall Rose. The problem was found by
	  Todd Copeland <todd.copeland@pervasive.com>, he provided the
	  patch as well.

2004-05-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* mime.man:
	* mime.test:
	* mime.tcl: Applied [SF Tcllib Patch 763712]. This extends the
	  functionality of mime::getbody with decoding of the mime part
	  based on the specified charset into the regular utf8
	  form. Testsuite was updated and extended as well. Thanks to
	  Matthew Walker <gunzel@users.sourceforge.net> for the
	  work. Updated the documentation for mime on my own. Bumped
	  version to 1.4.

	* mime:test:
	* mime.tcl: Applied [SF Tcllib Patch 758742], adding many more
	  MIME types for encodings to the knowledge-base of the
	  package. Thanks to Matthew Walker <gunzel@users.sourceforge.net>
	  for the work, and Mikhail Teterin <kot@users.sourceforge.net>
	  for prodding. Bumped version to 1.3.5.

	* mime.test:
	* mime.tcl (copymessageaux): Fixed [SF Tcllib Bug 620852]. Added
	  '-nonewline' to the puts statements which wrote out the chunks
	  read from the file associated with the mime part, converted or
	  not. As the data was [read] we had no business of adding eol's
	  during writing as well. Thanks to Jasper Taylor
	  <jaspert@users.sourceforge.net> for the report, and his
	  patience. Added a test for this as well, using files of similar
	  size as originally provided.

2004-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6 ========================
	* 

2004-02-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.test: Fixed access to files, was not done with
	  tcltest::testDirectory, causing them to be inaccessible
	  for 8.4+. The result in mime-2.2 was also dependent on the exact
	  order of keys retrieved from the array of parameters. Rewritten
	  to take this into account.

2004-01-30  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Better handling of failure in TLS setup. Added a
	policy command to control TLS policy on failure.

2004-01-29  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Added support for the STARTTLS extension (RFC 3207).
	This may also support old versions that report a TLS option in
	reply to EHLO, but these are not tested.

2003-11-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl (word_decode): Fixed [SF Tcllib Bug 764702], accepted
	  the patch coming with the bugreport (both by Reinhard Speyerer
	  <rspsf@users.sourceforge.net>). Command is now able to decode
	  data in encoded utf-8.

	* mime.test: Added test for the bug above.

2003-11-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl (smtp::hear): Integrated fix for [Bug 836442]. Limiting
	  seconds to 600 to prevent integer wraparound when setting up a
	  timer event. Bug reported (and fix provided) by Andreas Otto,
	  and accepted by Marshall Rose.

2003-06-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* mime.tcl (::mime::parsedatetime): Use string map instead of
	regsub - it's faster.

	* mime.test: Added tests which operate on the bad files below.

	* badmail2.txt: Added second piece of mail for testing.  If they
	turn out to be redundant, we can erase one.

	* badmail1.txt: Added mail for testing that triggers bug 631314.

2003-06-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* mime.tcl (::mime::word_decode): Accept lower-case encoding
	  specifiers. [Bug 732512]. Reported by Matthew Walker
	  <gunzel@users.sourceforge.net>, plus patch. Patch accepted by
	  Marshall Rose.

	* mime.test: Two more tests checking the acceptance of lower-case
	  encoding specifiers.

	* mime.tcl (::mime::parsepart): Reactivated error command, revert
	  to error on malformed mime input, instead of infinite
	  looping. [Bug 631314] reported by David Welton.

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl:  Applied patch for SF Tcllib bug #731759, as submitted
	* mime.test: by Matthew Walker <gunzel@users.sourceforge.net> and
	             accepted by Marshall Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>.
		     Update of the testsuite on my own.

2003-04-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* mime.man: Added a section for known bugs, and recorded 447037 as
	  such.

2003-04-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* smtp.tcl:
	* mime.tcl:
	* mime.man:
	* csmtp.man:
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Fixed bug #614591. Set version of the package to
	  to 1.3.3. Fixed equivalent of bug #648679.

2003-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.man: More semantic markup, less visual one.
	* smtp.man:

2003-01-06  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl (md5): Fix for bug # 630381. Use tcllib md5 to handle
	  Trf transparency.

2002-10-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.man: Changed -parse to -part in description of
	  "::mime::initialize". Thanks to "Gerald W. Lester"
	  <gerald.lester@cox.net> for finding this.

2002-09-16  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* smtp.man: Added example from http://mini.net/tcl/1256.

2002-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.test: Extended field_decode tests with the examples from
	  RFC 2047.

	* mime.tcl: Integrated new implementation of 'field_decode'
	  provided by Don Libes <don@libes.com>. This rewrite correctly
	  decodes all seven examples of RFC 2047. The old version decoded
	  only one correctly.

2002-08-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl: Accepted patch in SF FR #595240, provided by Marshall
	  T. Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>. The patch makes the code
	  more robust with respect to a common mime encoding error.

	* tcllib/examples/mime: Added an example application making use of
	  mime and smtp packages. Mbot is a highly-specialized filter for
	  personal messages. Again this is code provided to us by Marshall
	  T. Rose.

	* smtp.tcl: Followup patch to patch SF #557520/2. A line of code
	  initializing the options from the state was missing in one
	  command, causing problems with the usage of -maxsecs. This was
	  noted on c.l.t., by Acacio Cruz. The followup patch was provided
	  by Todd Coram.

2002-07-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Applied patch SF #557520/2 (== SF #558132) supplied by
	  Todd Coram <tcoram@users.sourceforge.net>on behalf of Marshall
	  Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>. This patch dispenses with
	  the automatic calculation of a timeout value and goes with a
	  user-supplied value (new option -maxsecs) instead. Default for
	  this option is 120 secs. This fixes bug SF #557040.

	* performance.tcl: New file. Script supplied by Pascal Scheffers
	  (see below) to test the performance of the mime package.

	* mime.tcl: Applied patch SF #585455 supplied by Pascal Scheffers
	  <pascalscheffers@users.sourceforge.net> on behalf of Marshall
	  Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>. This patch speeds up MIME
	  processing by using [split \n] and list ops to iterate over the
	  lines in the mail instead of using [string range] for doing it
	  incrementally, copying unprocessed data down again and again.

2002-06-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl: Fixed bug SF #548832. Report and patch by Michael
	  A. Cleverly <cleverly@users.sourceforge.net>.

2002-05-29  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl (smtp::initialize): Fixed SF bug #561416. The reporter
	  is unknown and provided the fix too. Fix approved by Marshall
	  Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>.

2002-05-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl: Accepted patch for SF bug #553784, by Don Porter
	  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* smtp.tcl: Applied patch for SF bug #539952, on behalf of
	  Marshall Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>. The part of the
	  patch regarding "mime.tcl" was already in the CVS, as part of
	  the fix for SF #477088, see 2001-11-01.

2002-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Applied patch for SF bug #547336 on behalf of Marshall
	  Rose <mrose@users.sourceforge.net>. Bug was reported by Don
	  Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>. This removes the duplicate
	  [package require Trf] we had before.

2002-04-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.man: Added doctools manpage.
	* smtp.man: Added doctools manpage.

2002-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Accepted patch by Simon Scott
	  <sjscott@users.sourceforge.net>, with slight modification. Fixes
	  bug #533025.

2002-02-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl: Accepted patch for bug #519623 by Rolf Ade
	  <rolf@pointsman.de>.

2002-02-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version set to 1.3.2 to differentiate the development code from
	  the 1.2 release containing 1.3.1.

	* mime.n: Applied patch 511692 provided by Larry Virden
	  <lvirden@users.sourceforge.net> fixing a formatting problem.

2002-01-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.3.1

2002-01-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Fixed bug #499242. Extended the non-trf branch of
	  smtp::wtextaux to detect and transform bare LF's into proper
	  CR/LF sequences.

2002-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.tcl (qp_encode): Implemented FR #503336, added
	  'no_softbreak' flag to qp_encode. Default value is false, giving
	  the original behaviour. If set the encoded data is not broken
	  into multiple lines, even if longer than 72 characters.

2001-11-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.n: Clarified documentation for 'parseaddress' in the wake
	  of bug #479174 as this is the command which actually handles the
	  value of option -recipients mentionend below.

	* smtp.n: Fixed bug #479144, clarified contents of value for
	  -recipients. Bug reported by Darren New
	  <dnew@users.sourceforge.net>.

2001-11-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: Fixed bug #472009. Changes in the handling of
	  script-level transformations cause the system to try to
	  initialize the read side of the 'smtp::wdata'
	  transformation. This fails. Added a dummy create/read branch to
	  the switch. Reported by 'nobody/anonymous', but possibly Andreas
	  Otto (deduced from the specified example).

	* mime.tcl: Added informaton about 7bit, 8bit, and binary encoding
	  to the places where it is missing. This fixes SF item
	  #477088. Bug was reported by Oliver Bienert
	  <obienert@users.sourceforge.net>.

2001-10-16  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mime.n:
	* mime.tcl:
	* smtp.n:
	* smtp.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Version up to 1.3

2001-09-12  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added manpages for smtp and mime packages.

2001-08-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* mime.tcl: made package require 8.3 and sped up qp_encode and
	qp_decode.

2001-07-10  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl: 
	* mime.tcl: Frink 2.2 run, fixed dubious code.

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* smtp.tcl:
	* mime.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink and procheck.

2001-01-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@interwoven.com>

	* mime.tcl: Applied patch from Peter MacDonald to correct problem
	with mime::initialize failing when mailers neglect to include
	the trailing boundary marker.

2000-09-20  Dan Kuchler  <kuchler@ajubasolutions.com>

        * smtp.tcl
        * mime.tcl: namespaced the procs that are created to replace
        the Trf functions when Trf isn't available.  This way they
        are not created in the global namespace, and there isn't any
        risk that they will collide with other global functions.

2000-09-04  Dan Kuchler  <kuchler@ajubasolutions.com>

        * README.xml
        * README.txt
        * README.html
        * mime.tcl:  Added proc header comment blocks to all procedures.
        Some are better than others, and they were written based on a
        quick analysis of the code and the documentation in the README
        file.  They should be updated as they change or are found to be
        inaccurate.

2000-09-01  Dan Kuchler  <kuchler@ajubasolutions.com>
       
        * mime.tcl
        * mime.test: Integrated a patch from Laurent Riesterer 
        (riesterer@celar.fr).  This patch added three new procedures
        (mime::word_encode, mime::word_decode, and mime::field_decode)
        The patch also adds support for word encoded items as defined
        in RFC 2047.  Fixed a bug in the quoted printable encode function
        mime::qp_encode

2000-08-15  Dan Kuchler  <kuchler@ajubasolutions.com>

        * mime.tcl
        * smtp.tcl: Made fixes so that smtp::sendmessage and
        mime::buildmessage work properly.  Fixed a bug where
        the "." at the start of a line was not being replaced
        by a ".." This was fine in base64 or in the default
        quoted printable, but was clearly broken in 8-bit or
        7-bit encodings.

2000-08-11  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* README.xml: 
	* README.html: 
	* README.txtl: Clarified information about soft-dependancy on Trf.

2000-08-03  Dan Kuchler <kuchler@ajubasolutions.com>

	* README.txt
	* README.xml
	* README.html
	* mime/smtp.tcl: Added a '-ports' option to smtp::sendmessage.
	The '-ports' option takes a list that should mirror the list of
	SMTP servers specified with the '-servers' flag. Documented the
	mime::reversemapencodings, mime::mapencodings, and
	smtp::buildmessage functions

	* mime/mime.tcl: Added mime::mapencoding and
	mime::reversemapencoding functions to map tcl encodings
	to their charset types, and back again.

	* mime/pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped the revision number from 1.1 to 1.2

2000-06-21  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Undid the #5693 fix.  It turns out there are
	situations where this is the desired behavior.  The basic idea is
	that the -recipients value is used in the SMTP envelope, and
	should not be mixed with message headers.  Basically, they're two
	totally different things.  I commented all the code and cleaned up
	some of the areas where side effects were being used unnecessarily
	and making the code hard to read.
	
2000-05-24  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed bug 5693, where the "To:" header wasn't
	being sent with an e-mail when using the -recipients flag of
	smtp::sendmessage.  Also, if -recipients was combined with -header
	"To ..." or -header "Cc ...", it would send the message only to
	-recipients (which is documented) but it would leave the Cc and To
	headers, which are wrong.  This is also fixed.

2000-05-23  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mime/mime.tcl
	* mime/mime.test: Fixed bugs 5521 and 5659, where qp_encode and
	qp_decode had numerous bugs.  See #5659 for details.

2000-05-22  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed a bug where if the requested mail server
	didn't exist (i.e. the host didn't have an SMTP server running),
	smtp::sendmessage would continue executing until a horrific crash
	at a later point.  I added the check and proper error reporting.

2000-05-06  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* mime/smtp.tcl: Fixed bug 5383, where smtp wouldn't work because
	it had a dependency on Trf.  I've patched the code, and it seems
	to work fine now.

2000-04-25  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* modules/mime/mime.test: Added a somewhat rudimentary test suite
	for TclMIME.  Found what I believe is a minor bug in the package,
	but decided not to fix it (and just let the relevant test fail)
	until I can discuss it with Brent.

2000-03-07  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* modules/mime/mime.tcl: Modified this to have a soft dependency on
	the Trf package.  If it is available then the encoding and decoding
	of MIME base64 and quoted-printable will run faster.
	Also added mime::buildmessage that creates the structured MIME message
	in a string and returns that - much like mime::copymessage that
	copies the message to a channel.
