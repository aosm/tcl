<h2><a name="overview">OVERVIEW</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_this_document">What is this document?</a></h4>



This is an atypical FAQ list, in that few of the questions are
frequently asked.  Rather, these are the questions I think a newcomer
to Snit should be asking.  This file is not a complete reference to
Snit, however; that information is in the <a href="snit.html">Snit man
page</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_snit">What is Snit?</a></h4>



Snit is a framework for defining abstract data types and megawidgets
in pure Tcl.  The name stands for "Snit's Not Incr Tcl", signifying
that Snit takes a different approach to defining objects than does
Incr Tcl, the best known object framework for Tcl.<p>

<h4><a name="what_version_of_tcl_does_snit_require">What version of Tcl does Snit require?</a></h4>



Snit requires version Tcl 8.4 or later.<p>

<h4><a name="what_are_snits_goals">What are Snit's goals?</a></h4>



In developing Snit I had the following goals:<p>

<ul>
  <li> It should be at least as efficient as the object code I'd been
       writing by hand.<p>

  <li> The fact that Snit was used in an object's implementation
       should be transparent (and irrelevant) to clients of that
       object.<p>

  <li> Snit should be able to encapsulate objects from other sources,
       particularly Tk widgets.<p>

  <li> Snit megawidgets should be (to the extent possible)
       indistinguishable in interface from Tk widgets.<p>

  <li> Snit should be Tclish--that is, rather than trying to emulate
       C++, Smalltalk, or anything else, it should try to emulate Tcl
       itself.<p>

  <li> It should have a simple, easy-to-use, easy-to-remember syntax.<p>
</ul><p>

<h4><a name="how_is_snit_different_from_other_oo_frameworks">How is Snit different from other OO frameworks?</a></h4>



Snit is unique among Tcl object systems (so far as I know) in that it's a
system based not on inheritance but on delegation.  Object systems
based on inheritance only allow you to inherit from classes defined
using the same system, and that's a shame.  In Tcl, an object
is anything that acts like an object; it shouldn't matter how the
object was implemented.  I designed Snit to help me build applications
out of the materials at hand; thus, Snit is designed to be able to
incorporate and build on any object, whether it's a hand-coded object,
a Tk widget, an Incr Tcl object, a BWidget or almost anything else.<p>

<h4><a name="what_can_i_do_with_snit">What can I do with Snit?</a></h4>



Using Snit, a programmer can:

<ul>
  <li> Create abstract data types and Tk megawidgets.<p>

  <li> Define instance variables, type variables, and option variables.<p>

  <li> Define constructors, destructors, instance methods, type
       methods, and several kinds of handler.<p>

  <li> Assemble a type out of component types.  Instance methods and
       options can be delegated to the component types automatically.<p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="objects">OBJECTS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_an_object">What is an object?</a></h4>



Obviously, a full description of object-oriented programming is beyond
the scope of this FAQ.  In simple terms, an object is an instance of
an abstract data type--a coherent bundle of code and data.

There are many ways to represent objects in Tcl/Tk; the best known
example are the Tk widgets.  A widget is an object; it is represented
by a Tcl command.  The object's methods are subcommands of the Tcl
command.  Snit uses the same conventions as Tk widgets do.

<h4><a name="what_is_an_abstract_data_type">What is an abstract data type?</a></h4>



In computer science terms, an abstract data type is a complex data
structure along with a set of operations, like a stack, a queue, or a
binary tree--that is to say, in modern terms, an object.  In systems
that include include some form of inheritance the word "class" is
usually used instead of "abstract data type", but as Snit doesn't do
inheritance, the older term seems more appropriate.  Sometimes this is
called <i>object-based</i> programming as opposed to <i>object-oriented</i>
programming.<p>

In Snit, as in Tk, a <i>type</i> is a command that creates
instances--objects--that belong to the type.  Most types define some
number of "options" that can be set at creation time, and usually can
be changed later.<p>

Further, an <i>instance</i> is also a Tcl command--a command that gives
access to the operations that are defined for that abstract data
type.  Conventionally, the operations are defined as subcommands, or
<a href="#instance_methods">instance methods</a> of
the instance command.  For example, to insert text into a Tk text
widget, you use the text widget's "insert" method:<p>

<pre>
    # Create a text widget and insert some text in it.
    text .mytext -width 80 -height 24
    .mytext insert end "Howdy!"
</pre>

In this example, "text" is the <i>type</i> command and ".mytext" is the
<i>instance</i> command.<p>


<h4><a name="what_kinds_of_abstract_data_types_does_snit_provide">What kinds of abstract data types does Snit provide?</a></h4>



Snit allows you to define three kinds of abstract data types:<p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>snit::type</code>
  <li> <code>snit::widget</code>
  <li> <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>
</ul><p>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_snittype">What is a snit::type?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::type</code> is a non-GUI abstract data type, e.g., a
stack or a queue.  <code>snit::types</code> are defined using the 
<code>snit::type</code> command.  For example, if you were designing
a kennel management system for a dog breeder, you'd need a dog type.<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    # ...
}
::dog
%</pre>

This definition defines a new command (<code>::dog</code>, in this
case) that can be used to define dog objects.<p>

An instance of a <code>snit::type</code> can have
<a href="#instance_methods">instance methods</a>,
<a href="#instance_variables">instance variables</a>, <a href="#options">options</a>, and
<a href="#components">components</a>.  The type itself
can have <a href="#type_methods">type methods</a> and <a href="#procs">procs</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_snitwidget">What is a snit::widget?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::widget</code> is a Tk megawidget built using Snit; it is
very similar to a <code>snit::type</code>.  See <a href="#widgets">WIDGETS</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_snitwidgetadaptor">What is a snit::widgetadaptor?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> uses Snit to wrap an existing
widget type (e.g., a Tk label), modifying its interface to a lesser or
greater extent.  It is very similar to a <code>snit::widget</code>.  See
<a href="#widgetadaptors">WIDGETADAPTORS</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_create_an_instance_of_a_snittype">How do I create an instance of a snit::type?</a></h4>



You create an instance of a <code>snit::type</code> by passing the new
instance's name to the type's create method.  In the following
example, we create a <code>dog</code> object called
<code>spot</code>.

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    # ....
}
::dog
% dog create spot
::spot
%</pre><p>

The "create" method name can be omitted so long as the instance name
doesn't conflict with any defined <a href="#type_methods">type methods</a>.  So the
following example is identical to the previous example:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    # ....
}
::dog
% dog spot
::spot
%</pre><p>

This document generally uses the shorter form.<p>

If the <code>dog</code> type defines <a href="#options">options</a>, these can
be given defaults at creation time:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -breed mongrel
    option -color brown

    method bark {} { return "$self barks." }
}
::dog
% dog create spot -breed dalmation -color spotted
::spot
% spot cget -breed
dalmation
% spot cget -color
spotted
%</pre><p>

Either way, the instance name now names a new Tcl command that is
used to manipulate the object.  For example, the following code makes
the dog bark:<p>

<pre>% spot bark
::spot barks.
%</pre>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_refer_to_an_object_indirectly">How do I refer to an object indirectly?</a></h4>



Some programmers prefer to save the object name in a variable, and
reference it that way.  For example,<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -breed mongrel
    option -color brown

    method bark {} { return "$self barks." }
}
::dog
% set d [dog spot -breed dalmation -color spotted]
::spot
% $d cget -breed
dalmation
% $d bark
::spot barks.
%</pre>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_generate_the_object_name_automatically">How can I generate the object name automatically?</a></h4>



If you'd like Snit to generate an object name for you, use the
"%AUTO%" keyword as the requested name:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    method bark {} { return "$self barks." }
}
::dog
% set d [dog %AUTO%]
::dog2
% $d bark
::dog2 barks.
%</pre>

The "%AUTO%" keyword can be embedded in a longer string:<p>

<pre>% set d [dog dog%AUTO%]
::dogdog5
% $d bark
::dogdog5 barks.
%</pre>


<h4><a name="can_types_be_renamed">Can types be renamed?</a></h4>



Tcl's "<code>rename</code>" command renames other commands.  It's a
common technique in Tcl to modify an existing command by renaming it
and defining a new command with the original name; the new command
usually calls the renamed command.<p>

<code>snit::type</code>'s, however, should never be renamed; to do so
breaks the connection between the type and its objects.<p>

<h4><a name="can_objects_be_renamed">Can objects be renamed?</a></h4>



Tcl's "<code>rename</code>" command renames other commands.  It's a
common technique in Tcl to modify an existing command by renaming it
and defining a new command with the original name; the new command
usually calls the renamed command.<p>

All Snit objects (including <a href="#widgets">widgets</a> and
<a href="#widgetadaptors">widgetadaptors</a>) can be renamed, though this flexibility has
some consequences:<p>

<ul>
  <li> In an instance method, $self will always contain the object's
       current name, so instance methods can always call other instance
       methods using $self.<p>

  <li> If the object is renamed, however, then $self's value will
       change.  Therefore,  don't use $self for anything that will
       break if $self changes. For example, don't pass a callback
       command to another object like this:<p>

       <pre>[list $self methodname args...]</pre><p>

       You'll get an error if this command is called after your
       object is renamed.<p>

  <li> Instead, the object should pass the callback command like this:<p>

       <pre>[mymethod methodname args...]</pre><p>

       The <code>mymethod</code> command returns code that will call
       the desired method safely; the caller of the callback can
       safely add additional arguments to the end of the command as
       usual.<p>

       For example, one could use this code to call a
       method when a Tk button is pushed:<p>

       <pre>.btn configure -command [list $self buttonpress]</pre><p>

       This will break if your instance is renamed.  Here's the safe
       way to do it:<p> 

       <pre>.btn configure -command [mymethod buttonpress]</pre><p>
       
  <li> Every object has a private namespace; the name of this namespace
       is available in method bodies, etc., as "$selfns".  This value is
       constant for the life the object.  Use "$selfns" instead of "$self" if
       you need a unique token to identify the object.<p>

  <li> When a snit::widget's instance command is renamed, its Tk window
       name remains the same--and is still extremely important.
       Consequently, the Tk window name is available in
       <code>snit::widget</code>
       method bodies, etc., as "$win".  This value is constant for the
       life of the object.  When creating child windows, it's best to 
       use "$win.child" rather than "$self.child" as the name of the
       child window.<p>

  <li> The names "selfns" and "win" may not be used as explicit
       argument names for typemethods, methods, constructors, or
       onconfigure handlers.<p>

  <li> procs defined in a Snit type or widget definition used to be
       able to reference instance variables if "$self" was passed to
       them explicitly as the argument "self"; this is no longer the
       case.<p>
</ul><p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_destroy_a_snit_object">How do I destroy a Snit object?</a></h4>



Every instance of a <code>snit::type</code> has a <code>destroy</code>
method:

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    method bark {} { return "$self barks." }
}
::dog
% dog spot
::spot
% spot bark
::spot barks.
% spot destroy
% info commands ::spot
%</pre>

Snit megawidgets (i.e., instances of <code>snit::widget</code> and
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>) are destroyed like any other widget:
by using the Tk <code>destroy</code> command on the widget or on one
of its ancestors in the window hierarchy.<p>

In addition, any Snit object of any type can be destroyed by renaming it to ""
using the Tcl <code>rename</code> command.<p>

<h2><a name="instance_methods">INSTANCE METHODS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_an_instance_method">What is an instance method?</a></h4>



An instance method is a procedure associated with a specific object.
It is given free access to all of the object's type variables,
instance variables, and so forth.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_an_instance_method">How do I define an instance method?</a></h4>



Instance methods are defined in the type definition using the "method"
statement.  Consider the following code that might be used to add dogs
to a computer simulation:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    method bark {} {
        return "$self barks."
    }

    method chase {thing} {
        return "$self chases $thing."
    }
}
::dog
%</pre>

A dog can bark, and it can chase things.<p>

The "method" statement looks just like a normal Tcl "proc", except
that it appears in a <code>snit::type</code> definition.
Notice that every instance method gets an implicit argument called
"<code>self</code>"; this argument contains the object's name.<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_a_client_call_an_instance_method">How does a client call an instance method?</a></h4>



The method name becomes a subcommand of the object.  For example,
let's put a simulated dog through its paces:<p>

<pre>% dog spot
::spot
% spot bark
::spot barks.
% spot chase cat
::spot chases cat.
%</pre>

<h4><a name="how_does_an_instance_method_call_another_instance_method">How does an instance method call another instance method?</a></h4>



If method A needs to call method B on the
same object, it does so just as a client does: it calls method B as a
subcommand of the object itself, using the object name stored in
"<code>self</code>".<p>

Suppose, for example, that our dogs never chase anything without
barking at them:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    method bark {} {
        return "$self barks."
    }

    method chase {thing} {
        return "$self chases $thing.  [$self bark]"
    }
}
::dog
% dog spot
::spot
% spot bark
::spot barks.
% spot chase cat
::spot chases cat.  ::spot barks.
%</pre>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_instance_method_names">Are there any limitations on instance method names?</a></h4>



Not really, so long as you avoid the standard instance method names:
<code>configure</code>, <code>configurelist</code>, <code>cget</code>,
<code>destroy</code>, and <code>info</code>.

<h4><a name="how_do_i_make_an_instance_method_private">How do I make an instance method private?</a></h4>



It's often useful to define private methods, that is, instance methods
intended to be called only by other methods of the same object.<p>

Snit doesn't implement any access control on instance methods, so all
methods are <i>de facto</i> public.  Conventionally, though, 
the names of public methods begin with a lower-case
letter, and the names of private methods begin with an upper-case
letter.<p>

For example, suppose our simulated dogs only bark in response to other
stimuli; they never bark just for fun.  So the "bark" method could be
private:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    # Private by convention: begins with uppercase letter.
    method Bark {} {
        return "$self barks."
    }

    method chase {thing} {
        return "$self chases $thing. [$self Bark]"
    }
}
::dog
% dog fido
::fido
% fido chase cat
::fido chases cat. ::fido barks.
%</pre>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_instance_method_arguments">Are there any limitations on instance method arguments?</a></h4>



Method argument lists are defined just like normal Tcl proc argument
lists; they can include default values, and the "args" argument.
However, every method is called with a number of implicit arguments
provided by Snit in addition to those explicitly defined.  The names
of these implicit arguments may not used to name explicit arguments.<p>

<h4><a name="what_implicit_arguments_are_passed_to_each_instance_method">What implicit arguments are passed to each instance method?</a></h4>



The arguments implicitly passed to every method are <code>type</code>,
<code>selfns</code>, <code>win</code>, and <code>self</code>.

<h4><a name="what_is_type">What is $type?</a></h4>



The implicit argument "<code>type</code>" contains the fully qualified
name of the object's type:<p>

<pre>% snit::type thing {
    method mytype {} {
        return $type
    }
}
::thing
% thing something
::something
% something mytype
::thing
%</pre>

<h4><a name="what_is_self">What is $self?</a></h4>



The implicit argument "<code>self</code>" contains the object's fully
qualified name.<p>

If the object's command is renamed, then "<code>$self</code>" will
change to match in subsequent calls.  Thus, your code should not
assume that "<code>$self</code>" is constant unless you know for sure
that the object will never be renamed.<p>

<pre>% snit::type thing {
    method myself {} {
        return $self
    }
}
::thing
% thing mutt
::mutt
% mutt myself
::mutt
% rename mutt jeff
% jeff myself
::jeff
%</pre>

<h4><a name="what_is_selfns">What is $selfns?</a></h4>



Each Snit object has a private namespace in which to store its
<a href="#instance_variables">instance variables</a> and <a href="#options">options</a>.
The implicit argument "<code>$selfns</code>" is the name of this
namespace; it never changes, and is constant for the life of the
object, even if the object's name changes:<p>

<pre>% snit::type thing {
    method myNameSpace {} {
        return $selfns
    }
}
::thing
% thing jeff
::jeff
% jeff myNameSpace
::thing::Snit_inst3
% rename jeff mutt
% mutt myNameSpace
::thing::Snit_inst3
%</pre>

The above example reveals how Snit names an instance's private
namespace; however, you should not write code that depends on the
specific naming convention, as it might change in future releases.<p>


<h4><a name="what_is_win">What is $win?</a></h4>



The implicit argument "<code>win</code>" is defined for all Snit
methods, including those of <a href="#widgets">widgets</a> and
<a href="#widgetadaptors">widgetadaptors</a>, though it makes sense mostly for the latter
two kinds.  "<code>$win</code>" is simply the original name of the
object, whether it's been renamed or not.  For widgets and
widgetadaptors, it is also therefore the name of a Tk window.

When a <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> is used to modify the
interface of a widget or megawidget, it must rename the widget's
original command and replace it with its own.  Thus, using
"<code>$win</code>" whenever the Tk window name is called for means
that a <code>snit::widget</code> or <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>
can be adapted by a <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>.
See <a href="#widgets">WIDGETS</a> for more information.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_pass_an_instance_method_as_a_callback">How do I pass an instance method as a callback?</a></h4>



It depends on the context.  Suppose in my application I have a
<code>dog</code> object named <code>fido</code>, and I want
<code>fido</code> to bark when a Tk button is pressed.  In this case,
I pass the instance method in the normal way, as a subcommand of
<code>fido</code>:<p>

<pre>button .bark -text "Bark!" -command [list fido bark]</pre>

In typical Tcl style, we use a callback to hook two independent
components together.  But what if the <code>dog</code> object
itself, passing one of its own instance methods to another object (one
of its components, say)?  The obvious thing to do is this:<p>

<pre>% snit::widget dog {
    constructor {args} {
        #...
        button $win.barkbtn -text "Bark!"  -command [list $self bark]
        #...
    }
}
::dog
%</pre>

(Note that in this example, our <code>dog</code> becomes a
<code>snit::widget</code>, because it has GUI behavior.  See
<a href="#widgets">WIDGETS</a> for more.)  Thus, if we create a <code>dog</code>
called <code>.spot</code>, it will create a Tk button called
<code>.barkbtn</code> and pass it "<code>$self bark</code>" as the
command.<p>

Now, this will work--provided that <code>.spot</code> is never
renamed.  But why should <code>.spot</code> be renamed?  Surely
renaming widgets is abnormal?  And so it is--unless <code>.spot</code>
is the <a href="#what_is_a_hull_component">hull component</a> of a
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>.
If it is, then it will be renamed, and <code>.spot</code> will name the
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> object.  When the button is pressed,
the command "<code>$self bark</code>" will be handled by the
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>, which might or might not do the
right thing.<p>

There's a safer way to do it, and it looks like this:<p>

<pre>% snit::widget dog {
    constructor {args} {
        #...
        button $win.barkbtn -text "Bark!"  -command [mymethod bark]
        #...
    }
}
::dog
%</pre>

The command <code>mymethod</code> can be used like <code>list</code>
to build up a callback command; the only difference is that
<code>mymethod</code> returns a form of the command that won't change
if the instance's name changes.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_delegate_instance_methods_to_a_component">How do I delegate instance methods to a component?</a></h4>



See <a href="#delegation">DELEGATION</a>.<p>

<h2><a name="instance_variables">INSTANCE VARIABLES</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_an_instance_variable">What is an instance variable?</a></h4>



An instance variable is a private variable associated with some particular
Snit object.  Instance variables can be scalars or arrays.<p>

<h4><a name="how_is_a_scalar_instance_variable_defined">How is a scalar instance variable defined?</a></h4>



Scalar instance variables are defined in the type definition using the
<code>variable</code> statement.  You can simply name it, or you can
initialize it with a value:

<pre>snit::type mytype {
    # Define variable "greeting" and initialize it with "Howdy!"
    variable greeting "Howdy!"
}</pre>

<h4><a name="how_is_an_array_instance_variable_defined">How is an array instance variable defined?</a></h4>



Array instance variables are also defined using the
<code>variable</code> command; however, you can't initialize them
using the variable command.  Typically, they get initialized in the
constructor:<p>

<pre>snit::type mytype {
    # Define array variable "greetings"
    variable greetings

    constructor {args} {
        set greetings(formal) "Good Evening"
        set greetings(casual) "Howdy!"
    }
}</pre>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_instance_variable_names">Are there any limitations on instance variable names?</a></h4>



Just a few.<p>

First, every Snit object has a built-in instance
variable called "options", which should never be redefined.<p>

Second, all names beginning with "Snit_" or "snit_" are reserved for
use by Snit internal code.<p>

Third, instance variable names with the namespace delimiter ("::") in them
are likely to cause great confusion.<p>

<h4><a name="do_i_need_to_declare_instance_variables_before_using_them">Do I need to declare instance variables before using them?</a></h4>



No. Once you've defined an instance variable in the type definition, it
can be used in any instance code without declaration.  This differs
from normal Tcl practice, in which all non-local variables in a proc
need to be declared.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_pass_an_instance_variables_name_to_another_object">How do I pass an instance variable's name to another object?</a></h4>



In Tk, it's common to pass a widget a variable name; for example, Tk
label widgets have a <code>-textvariable</code> option which names the
variable which will contain the widget's text.  This allows the
program to update the label's value just by assigning a new value to
the variable.<p>

If you naively pass the instance variable name to the label widget,
you'll be confused by the result; Tk will assume that the name names a
global variable.  Instead, you need to provide a fully-qualified
variable name.  From within an instance method or a constructor, you
can fully qualify the variable's name using the <code>varname</code>
command:<p> 

<pre>snit::widget mywidget {
    variable labeltext ""

    constructor {args} {
        # ...

        label $win.label -textvariable [varname labeltext]

        # ...
    }
}</pre>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_make_an_instance_variable_public">How do I make an instance variable public?</a></h4>



Practically speaking, you don't.  Instead, you'll implement public
variables as <a href="#options">options</a>.  Alternatively, you can write
<a href="#instance_methods">instance methods</a> to set and get the variable's value.<p>

<h2><a name="options">OPTIONS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_an_option">What is an option?</a></h4>



A type's options are the equivalent of what other object-oriented
languages would call public member variables or properties: they are
data values which can be retrieved and (usually) set by the clients of
an object.  If a type is to be used a record type, it's possible that
options are all that's needed.<p>

Snit's implementation of options follows the Tk model fairly exactly,
except that <code>snit::type</code> objects can't interact with Tk's
option database; <code>snit::widget</code> and
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> objects, on the other hand, can and
do.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_an_option">How do I define an option?</a></h4>



Options are defined in the type definition using the
<code>option</code> statement.  Consider the following type, to be
used in an application that manages a list of dogs for a pet store:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -breed mongrel
    option -color brown
    option -akc 0
    option -shots 0
}
::dog
%</pre>
</pre>

According to this, a dog has four notable properties, or options: a
breed, a color, a flag that says whether it's pedigreed with the
American Kennel Club, and another flag that says whether it has had its
shots.  The default dog, evidently, is a brown mutt.<p>

If no default value is specified, the option's value defaults to the
empty string, {}.<p>

The Snit man page refers to these as "locally defined" options.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_a_client_set_options_at_object_creation">How can a client set options at object creation?</a></h4>



The normal convention is that the client may pass any number of
options and their values after the object's name at object creation.
For example, the ::dog command defined in the previous answer can now
be used to define individual dogs.  Any or 
all of the options may be set at creation time.<p>

<pre>% dog spot -breed beagle -color "mottled" -akc 1 -shots 1
::spot
% dog fido -shots 1
::fido
%</pre>

So ::spot is a pedigreed beagle; ::fido is a typical mutt, but his owners
evidently take care of him, because he's had his shots.<p>

NOTE: If the type defines a constructor, it can specify a different
object-creation syntax.  See <a href="#constructors">CONSTRUCTORS</a> for more
information.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_a_client_retrieve_an_options_value">How can a client retrieve an option's value?</a></h4>



Retrieve option values using the <code>cget</code> method:<p>

<pre>% spot cget -color
mottled
% fido cget -breed
mongrel
%</pre>

<h4><a name="how_can_a_client_set_options_after_object_creation">How can a client set options after object creation?</a></h4>



Any number of options may be set at one time using the
<code><a href="#configure">configure</a></code> instance method.  Suppose that closer inspection
shows that ::fido is a rare Arctic Boar Hound of a lovely dun color:<p>

<pre>% fido configure -color dun -breed "Arctic Boar Hound"
% fido cget -color
dun
% fido cget -breed
Arctic Boar Hound
%</pre>

Alternatively, the <code>configurelist</code> method takes a list of
options and values; this is sometimes more convenient:<p>

<pre>% set features [list -color dun -breed "Arctic Boar Hound"]
-color dun -breed {Arctic Boar Hound}
% fido configurelist $features
% fido cget -color
dun
% fido cget -breed
Arctic Boar Hound
%</pre>


<h4><a name="how_should_an_instance_method_access_an_option_value">How should an instance method access an option value?</a></h4>



There are two ways an instance method can set and retrieve an option's
value.  One is to use the <code>configure</code> and <code>cget</code>
methods, as shown below:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -weight 10

    method gainWeight {} {
        set wt [$self cget -weight]
        incr wt
        $self configure -weight $wt
    }
}
::dog
% dog fido
::fido
% fido cget -weight
10
% fido gainWeight
% fido cget -weight
11
%</pre>

Alternatively, Snit provides a built-in array instance variable called
<code>options</code>.  The indices are the option names; the values
are the option values.  The method given above can thus be rewritten
as follows:<p>

<pre>    method gainWeight {
        incr options(-weight)
    }</pre>

As you can see, using the <code>options</code> variable involves
considerably less typing.  If you define <code>onconfigure</code> or
<code>oncget</code> handlers, as described in the following answers,
you might wish to use the <code>configure</code> and <code>cget</code>
methods anyway, just so that any special processing you've implemented
is sure to get done.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_catch_changes_to_an_options_value">How can I catch changes to an option's value?</a></h4>



Use an <code>onconfigure</code> handler.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_an_onconfigure_handler">What is an onconfigure handler?</a></h4>



An <code>onconfigure</code> handler is a special kind of instance
method that's called whenever the related option is given a new value
via the <code>configure</code> or <code>configurelist</code> instance
methods. The handler can validate the new value, pass it to some other
object, and anything else you'd like it to do.<p>

An <code>onconfigure</code> handler is defined by an
<code>onconfigure</code> statement in the type definition.  Here's
what the default configuration behavior would look like if written as
an <code>onconfigure</code> handler:<p>

<pre>snit::type dog {
    option -color brown

    onconfigure -color {value} {
        set options(-color) $value
    }
}</pre>

The name of the handler is just the option name.  The
argument list must have exactly one argument; it can be called almost
anything, but conventionally it is called "value".  Within the handler,
the argument is set to the new value; also, all instance variables are
available, just as in an instance method.<p>

Note that if your handler doesn't put the value in the
<code>options</code> array, it doesn't get updated.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_catch_accesses_to_an_options_value">How can I catch accesses to an option's value?</a></h4>



Use an <code>oncget</code> handler.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_an_oncget_handler">What is an oncget handler?</a></h4>



An <code>oncget</code> handler is a special kind of instance method that's
called whenever the related option's value is queried via the
<code>cget</code> instance method.  The handler can compute the value,
retrieve it from a database, or anything else you'd like it to do.<p>

An <code>oncget</code> handler is defined by an
<code>oncget</code> statement in the type definition.  Here's
what the default behavior would look like if written as
an <code>oncget</code> handler:<p>

<pre>snit::type dog {
    option -color brown

    oncget -color {
        return $options(-color)
    }
}</pre>

The handler takes no arguments, and so has no argument list; however,
all instance variables are available, just as they are in normal
instance methods.<p>

<h2><a name="type_variables">TYPE VARIABLES</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_type_variable">What is a type variable?</a></h4>



A type variable is a private variable associated with a Snit type
rather than with a particular instance of the type.  In C++ and Java,
the equivalent of type variables are called static member variables.
Type variables can be scalars or arrays.<p>

<h4><a name="how_is_a_scalar_type_variable_defined">How is a scalar type variable defined?</a></h4>



Scalar type variables are defined in the type definition using the
<code>typevariable</code> statement.  You can simply name it, or you can
initialize it with a value:

<pre>snit::type mytype {
    # Define variable "greeting" and initialize it with "Howdy!"
    typevariable greeting "Howdy!"
}</pre>

Every object of type <code>mytype</code> now has access to a single
variable called "greeting".<p>

<h4><a name="how_is_an_array_type_variable_defined">How is an array type variable defined?</a></h4>



Array-valued type variables are also defined using the
<code>typevariable</code> command; however, you can't initialize them
that way, just as you can't initialize array variables using Tcl's
standard <code>variable</code> command.
<a href="#type_constructors">Type constructors</a> are the usual way to initialize

<h4><a name="how_do_i_make_a_type_variable_public">How do I make a type variable public?</a></h4>



There are two ways to do this.  The preferred way is to write a pair

Alternatively, you can publicize the variable's name in your
documentation and clients can access it directly.  For example,<p>

<pre>snit::type mytype {
    typevariable myvariable
}

set ::mytype::myvariable "New Value"</pre>

As shown, type variables are stored in the type's namespace, which has
the same name as the type itself.<p>

<h2><a name="type_methods">TYPE METHODS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_type_method">What is a type method?</a></h4>



A type method is a procedure associated with the type itself rather
than with any specific instance of the type.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_type_method">How do I define a type method?</a></h4>



Type methods are defined in the type definition using the "typemethod"
statement:<p>

<pre>snit::type dog {
    # List of pedigreed dogs
    typevariable pedigreed

    typemethod pedigreedDogs {} {
        return $pedigreed
    }

    # ...
}</pre>

Suppose the <code>dog</code> type maintains a list of the names of the
dogs that have pedigrees.  The <code>pedigreedDogs</code> type method
returns this list.<p>

The "typemethod" statement looks just like a normal Tcl "proc", except
that it appears in a <code>snit::type</code> definition.  It defines
the method name, the argument list, and the
body of the method.<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_a_client_call_a_type_method">How does a client call a type method?</a></h4>



The method name becomes a subcommand of the type's command.  For example,<p>

    # List of pedigreed dogs
    typevariable pedigreed

    typemethod pedigreedDogs {} {
        return $pedigreed
    }

    # ...

dog spot -pedigreed 1

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_type_method_names">Are there any limitations on type method names?</a></h4>



Not really, so long as you avoid the standard type method names:<p>
<code>create</code> and <code>info</code>.

<h4><a name="how_do_i_make_a_type_method_private">How do I make a type method private?</a></h4>



It's sometimes useful to define private type methods, that is, type methods
intended to be called only by other type or instance methods of the
same object.<p>

Snit doesn't implement any access control on type methods; by
convention, the names of public methods begin with a lower-case
letter, and the names of private methods begin with an upper-case
letter.<p>

Alternatively, a Snit "proc" can be used as a private type method; see
<a href="#procs">PROCS</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_type_method_arguments">Are there any limitations on type method arguments?</a></h4>



Method argument lists are defined just like normal Tcl proc argument
lists; they can include default values, and the "args" argument.
However, every type method is called with an implicit argument called
"type" that contains the name of the type command.  In addition, type
methods should by convention avoid using the names of the arguments
implicitly defined for <a href="#instance_methods">instance methods</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_an_instance_or_type_method_call_a_type_method">How does an instance or type method call a type method?</a></h4>



If an instance or type method needs to call a type method,
it should use "$type" to do so:<p>

<pre>snit::type dog {

    typemethod pedigreedDogs {} { ... }

    typemethod printPedigrees {} {
        foreach obj [$type pedigreedDogs] { ... }
    }
}</pre><p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_pass_a_type_method_as_a_callback">How do I pass a type method as a callback?</a></h4>



It's common in Tcl to pass a snippet of code to another object, for it
to call later.  Because types cannot be renamed, the thing to do is
just use the type name, or, if the callback is registered from within
a type method, "<code>$type</code>".  For example, suppose we want to print
a list of pedigreed dogs when a Tk button is pushed:<p>

<pre>button .btn -text "Pedigrees" -command [list dog printPedigrees]
pack .btn</pre>

<h2><a name="procs">PROCS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_proc">What is a proc?</a></h4>



A Snit "proc" is really just a Tcl proc defined within the type's
namespace.  You can use procs for private code that isn't related to
any particular instance.  For example, I often find myself writing a
proc to pop the first item off of a list stored in a variable.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_proc">How do I define a proc?</a></h4>



Procs are defined by including a "proc" statement in the type definition:<p>

<pre>snit::type mytype {
    # Pops and returns the first item from the list stored in the
    # listvar, updating the listvar
   proc pop {listvar} { ... }

   # ...
}</pre>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_proc_names">Are there any limitations on proc names?</a></h4>



Any name can be used, so long as it does not begin with "Snit_"; names
beginning with "Snit_" are reserved for Snit's own use.  However, the
wise programmer will avoid proc names like "set", "list", "if", and
so forth that would shadow standard Tcl command names.<p>

By convention, proc names, being private, begin with a capital letter.<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_a_method_call_a_proc">How does a method call a proc?</a></h4>



Just like it calls any Tcl command.  For example,<p>

<pre>snit::type mytype {
    # Pops and returns the first item from the list stored in the
    # listvar, updating the listvar
    proc Pop {listvar} { ... }

    variable requestQueue {}

    # Get one request from the queue and process it.
    method processRequest {} {
        set req [Pop requestQueue]
    }
}</pre>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_pass_a_proc_to_another_object_as_a_callback">How can I pass a proc to another object as a callback?</a></h4>



I tend to use type or instance methods for this purpose and ignore
procs altogether.  But if you really need to, the
<code>codename</code> command returns the proc's fully qualified
name.<p>

<h2><a name="type_constructors">TYPE CONSTRUCTORS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_type_constructor">What is a type constructor?</a></h4>



A type constructor is a body of code that initializes the type as a
whole, rather like a C++ static initializer.  The body of a type
constructor is executed once when the type is defined, and never
again.<p>

A type can have at most one type constructor.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_type_constructor">How do I define a type constructor?</a></h4>



A type constructor is defined by using the
<code>typeconstructor</code> statement in the type definition.  For
example, suppose the type uses an array-valued type variable as a
look up table:<p>

<pre>% snit::type mytype {
    typevariable lookupTable

    typeconstructor {
        array set lookupTable {key value...}
    }
}
::mytype
%</pre>


<h2><a name="constructors">CONSTRUCTORS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_constructor">What is a constructor?</a></h4>



In object-oriented programming, an object's constructor is responsible
for initializing the object completely at creation time.   The constructor
receives the list of options passed to the <code>snit::type</code>
command's create method and can then do whatever it likes.  That might
include computing instance variable values, reading data from files,
creating other objects, updating type variables, and so forth.<p>

The constructor doesn't return anything.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_constructor">How do I define a constructor?</a></h4>



A constructor is defined by using the <code>constructor</code>
statement in the type definition.  Suppose that it's desired to keep a
list of all pedigreed dogs.  The list can be maintained in a type
variable and retrieved by a type method.  Whenever a dog is created,
it can add itself to the list--provided that it's registered with the
American Kennel Club.<p> 

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -akc 0

    typevariable akcList {}

    constructor {args} {
        $self configurelist $args

        if {$options(-akc)} {
            lappend akcList $self
        }
    }

    typemethod akclist {} {
        return $akcList
    }
}
::dog
% dog spot -akc 1
::spot
% dog fido
::fido
% dog akclist
::spot
%</pre>

<h4><a name="what_does_the_default_constructor_do">What does the default constructor do?</a></h4>



If you don't provide a constructor explicitly, you get the default
constructor, which looks like this:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -breed mongrel
    option -color brown
    option -akc 0

    constructor {args} {
        $self configurelist $args
    }
}
::dog
% dog spot -breed dalmatian -color spotted -akc 1
::spot
%</pre>

When the constructor is called, "args" will be set to the list of
arguments that follow the object's name.  The constructor is allowed
to interprete this list any way it chooses; the normal convention is
to assume that it's a list of option names and values, as shown in the
example above.  If you simply want to save the option values, you
should use the <code>configurelist</code> method, as shown.<p>

<h4><a name="can_i_choose_a_different_command_line_syntax_for_the_constructor">Can I choose a different command line syntax for the constructor?</a></h4>



Yes, you can.  For example, suppose we wanted to be sure that the
breed was explicitly stated for every dog at creation time, and
couldn't be changed thereafter.  One way to do that is as follows:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    variable breed

    option -color brown
    option -akc 0

    constructor {theBreed args} {
        set breed $theBreed
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    method breed {} {
        return $breed
    }
}
::dog
% dog spot dalmatian -color spotted -akc 1
::spot
% spot breed
dalmatian
%</pre>

The drawback is that this creation syntax is non-standard, and may
limit the compatibility of your new type with other people's code.
For example, Snit generally assumes that <a href="#components">components</a> use
the standard creation syntax.<p>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_constructor_arguments">Are there any limitations on constructor arguments?</a></h4>



Constructor argument lists are defined just like normal Tcl proc argument
list; they can include default values, and the "args" argument.
However, the constructor is called with a number of implicit arguments
provided by Snit in addition to those explicitly defined.  The names
of these implicit arguments may not used to name explicit arguments.<p>

<h4><a name="what_implicit_arguments_are_passed_to_the_constructor">What implicit arguments are passed to the constructor?</a></h4>



The constructor gets the same implicit arguments that are passed to
<a href="#instance_methods">instance methods</a>: <code>type</code>,
<code>selfns</code>, <code>win</code>, and <code>self</code>.<p>

<h2><a name="destructors">DESTRUCTORS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_destructor">What is a destructor?</a></h4>



A destructor is a special kind of method that's called when an object
is destroyed.  It's responsible for doing any necessary clean-up when
the object goes away: destroying components, closing files, and so
forth.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_destructor">How do I define a destructor?</a></h4>



Destructors are defined by using the <code>destructor</code> statement
in the type definition.  Suppose we're maintaining a list of pedigreed
dogs; then we'll want to remove dogs from it when they are
destroyed.<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    option -akc 0

    typevariable akcList {}

    constructor {args} {
        $self configurelist $args

        if {$options(-akc)} {
            lappend akcList $self
        }
    }

    destructor {
        set ndx [lsearch $akcList $self]

        if {$ndx != -1} {
            set akcList [lreplace $akcList $ndx $ndx]
        }
    }

    typemethod akclist {} {
        return $akcList
    }
}
::dog
% dog spot -akc 1
::spot
% dog fido -akc 1
::fido

::spot ::fido
% fido destroy
% dog akclist
::spot
%</pre>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_destructor_arguments">Are there any limitations on destructor arguments?</a></h4>



Yes; a destructor has no explicit arguments.<p>

<h4><a name="what_implicit_arguments_are_passed_to_the_destructor">What implicit arguments are passed to the destructor?</a></h4>



The destructor gets the same implicit arguments that are passed to
<a href="#instance_methods">instance methods</a>: <code>type</code>,
<code>selfns</code>, <code>win</code>, and <code>self</code>.<p>

<h4><a name="must_components_be_destroyed_explicitly">Must components be destroyed explicitly?</a></h4>



Yes and no.<p>

For a Snit megawidget (<code>snit::widgets</code> and
<code>snit::widgetadaptors</code>), any widget <a href="#components">components</a>
created by it will be destroyed automatically when the megawidget is
destroyed, in keeping with normal Tk behavior (destroying a parent
widget destroys the whole tree).

On the other hand, all non-widget components of a Snit megawidget, and
all components of a normal <code>snit::type</code> object, must be
destroyed explicitly in a destructor.<p>

<h2><a name="components">COMPONENTS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_component">What is a component?</a></h4>



Often an object will create and manage a number of other objects.  One
example is a Snit megawidget that composes a number of Tk widgets.
These objects are part of the main object and are thus are called
components of it.<p>

But Snit also has a more precise meaning for "component".  The
components of a Snit object are those objects created by it to which
methods and options can be delegated.  See <a href="#delegation">DELEGATION</a> for
more information about delegation.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_create_a_component">How do I create a component?</a></h4>



First, you must decide what role a component plays within your object,
and give the role a name.  For example, suppose your <code>dog</code>
object creates a <code>tail</code> object (the better to wag with, no
doubt).  The <code>tail</code> object will have some command name, but
you tell Snit about it using its role name, as follows:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    # Define component name as an instance variable
    variable mytail

    constructor {args} {
        # Create and save the component's command
        install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    method wag {} {
        $mytail wag
    }
}
::dog</pre>

As shown here, it doesn't matter what the <code>tail</code> object's
real name is; the <code>dog</code> object refers to it by its
component name.<p>

The above example shows one way to delegate the "wag" method to
the "mytail" component; see <a href="#delegation">DELEGATION</a> for an easier
way.<p>

<h4><a name="how_is_a_component_named">How is a component named?</a></h4>



A component has two names.  The first name represents the role the
component object plays within the Snit object.  This is the component
name proper, and is the name used to refer to the component within
Snit code.  The second name is the name of the actual component object
created by the Snit object's constructor.  This second name is always
a Tcl command name, and is referred to as the component's object name.<p>

In the example in the previous FAQ, the component name is "mytail";
the "mytail" component's object name is chosen automatically by Snit
since %AUTO% was used when the component object was created.<p>

<h4><a name="what_does_the_install_command_do">What does the install command do?</a></h4>



The <code>install</code> command creates the component using the
specified command (<code>tail %AUTO% -partof $self</code>), and
assigns the result to the <code>mytail</code> variable.  For
<code>snit::types</code>, the <code>install</code> command shown
above is equivalent to the following command:<p>

<pre>        set mytail [tail %AUTO% -partof $self]</pre>

For <code>snit::widgets</code> and <code>snit::widgetadaptors</code>,
however, the <code>install</code> command also queries
<a href="#the_tk_option_database">the Tk option database</a> and initializes the component's
options accordingly.  For consistency, it's a good idea to get in the
habit of using <code>install</code> for all components.<p>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_component_names">Are there any limitations on component names?</a></h4>



Yes.  <code>snit::widget</code> and <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code>
have a special component called the <code>hull</code> component; thus,
the name <code>hull</code> should be used for no other purpose.<p>

Component names are in fact instance variable names, and so follow the
rules for <a href="#instance_variables">instance variables</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="are_there_any_limitations_on_component_object_names">Are there any limitations on component object names?</a></h4>



Yes.

Component objects which are Tk widgets or megawidgets must have valid
Tk window names.

Component objects which are not widgets or megawidgets must have
fully-qualified command names, i.e., names which include the full
namespace of the command.  Note that Snit always creates objects with
fully qualified names.

Second, component object names must be unique.  This is no problem for
widget components, since widget names are always unique; but consider
the following code:

<pre>    snit::type tail { ... }

    snit::type dog {
        delegate method wag to mytail

        constructor {} {
            install mytail using tail mytail
        }
    }</pre>

This code uses the component name, "mytail", as the component object
name.  This is not good, and here's why: Snit instance code executes
in the Snit type's namespace.  In this case, the mytail component is
created in the ::dog:: namespace, and will thus have the name
::dog::mytail.<p>

Now, suppose you create two dogs.  Both will have a mytail component
called ::dog::mytail.  In other words, you've got two dogs with one
tail between them.  This is very bad.  Here are a couple of ways to
avoid it:<p>

First, if the component type is a <code>snit::type</code> you can
specify %AUTO% as its name, and be guaranteed to get a unique name.
This is the safest thing to do:<p>

<pre>    install mytail using tail %AUTO%</pre>

If the component type isn't a <code>snit::type</code> you can base the
component's object name on the type's name in some way:<p>

<pre>     install mytail using tail $self.mytail</pre>

This isn't as safe, but should usually work out okay.<p>

<h4><a name="must_i_destroy_the_components_i_create">Must I destroy the components I create?</a></h4>



That depends.  When a parent widget is destroyed, all child widgets
are destroyed automatically.  Thus, if your object is a
<code>snit::widget</code> or <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> you
don't need to destroy any components that are widgets.<p>

Any non-widget components, however, and all components of a
<code>snit::type</code> object, must be destroyed explicitly.  This is
true whether you assign them a component name or not.<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    variable mytail

    constructor {args} {
        install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    destructor {
        $mytail destroy
    }
}
::dog
%</pre>

Note that this code assumes that <code>tail</code> is also a
<code>snit::type</code>; if not, it might need to be destroyed in some
other way.<p>

<h4><a name="can_i_expose_a_components_object_command_as_part_of_my_interface">Can I expose a component's object command as part of my interface?</a></h4>



Yes, and there are two ways to do it.  The most appropriate way is
usually to use <a href="#delegation">delegation</a>.  Delegation allows you to
pass the options and methods you specify along to particular
components.  This effectively hides the components from the users of
your type, and ensures good encapsulation.<p>

However, there are times when it's appropriate, not to mention
simpler, just to make the entire component part of your type's public
interface.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_expose_a_components_object_command">How do I expose a component's object command?</a></h4>



Use the <code>expose</code> statement.  For example, suppose you're
creating a combobox megawidget which owns a listbox widget, and you
want to make the listbox's entire interface public.  You can do this:<p>

<pre>snit::widget combobox {
     expose listbox

     constructor {args} {
         install listbox using listbox $win.listbox ....

         #...
     }

     #...
}

combobox .mycombo
.mycombo listbox configure -width 30</pre>

The <code>expose</code> statement exposes the named component by
defining a method of the same name.  The method's arguments are passed
along to the component.  Thus, the above code sets the listbox
component's "-width" to 30.<p>

If called with no arguments, the method returns the component's object
name:<p>

<pre>% .mycombo listbox
.mycombo.listbox</pre>

Usually you'll let the method name be the same as the component name;
however, you can rename it if necessary.  The code in the following
listing exposes the same interface as the previous example:<p>

<pre>snit::widget combobox {
     expose mylistbox as listbox

     constructor {args} {
         install mylistbox using listbox $win.mylistbox ....

         #...
     }

     #...
}
combobox .mycombo
.mycombo listbox configure -width 30</pre>

<h2><a name="delegation">DELEGATION</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_delegation">What is delegation?</a></h4>



Delegation, simply put, is when you pass a task you've been given to
one of your assistants.  (You do have assistants, don't you?)  Snit
objects can do the same thing.  The following example shows one way in
which the <code>dog</code> object can delegate its <code>wag</code>
method and its <code>-taillength</code> option to its
<code>tail</code> component.<p> 

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    variable mytail

    option -taillength

    onconfigure -taillength {value} {
         $mytail configure -length $value
    }

    oncget -taillength {
         $mytail cget -length
    }

    constructor {args} {
        install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    method wag {} {
        $mytail wag
    }
}
::dog
% snit::type tail {
    option -length 5
    option -partof
    method wag {} { return "Wag, wag, wag."}
}
::tail
% dog spot -taillength 7
::spot
% spot cget -taillength
7
% spot wag
Wag, wag, wag.
%</pre>

This is the hard way to do it, by it demonstrates what delegation is
all about.  See the following answers for the easy way to do it.<p>

Note that the constructor calls the <code>configurelist</code> method
<b>after</b> it creates its <code>tail</code>; otherwise, if
<code>-taillength</code> appeared in the list of <code>args</code>
we'd get an error.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_delegate_a_method_to_a_component_object">How can I delegate a method to a component object?</a></h4>



Delegation occurs frequently enough that Snit makes it easy.  Any
method can be delegated to any component by placing a single
<code>delegate</code> statement in the type definition.  (See
<a href="#components">COMPONENTS</a> for more information about component names.)<p>

For example, here's a much better way to delegate the <code>dog</code>
object's <code>wag</code> method:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    delegate method wag to mytail

    constructor {args} {
        install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }
}
::dog
% snit::type tail {
    option -length 5
    option -partof
    method wag {} { return "Wag, wag, wag."}
}
::tail
% dog spot
::spot
% spot wag
Wag, wag, wag.
%</pre>

This code has the same affect as the code shown under the previous
question: when a <code>dog</code>'s <code>wag</code> method is called,
the call and its arguments are passed along automatically to the
<code>tail</code> object.<p>

Note that when a component is mentioned in a <code>delegate</code>
statement, the component's instance variable is defined implicitly.<p>

Note also that you can define a method name using the <code>method</code>
statement, or you can define it using <code>delegate</code>; you can't
do both.<p>

<h4><a name="can_i_delegate_to_a_method_with_a_different_name">Can I delegate to a method with a different name?</a></h4>



Suppose the <code>tail</code> object has a <code>wiggle</code> method
instead of a <code>wag</code> method, and you  want to delegate the
<code>dog</code>'s <code>wag</code> method to the <code>tail</code>'s
<code>wiggle</code> method.  It's easily done:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    delegate method wag to mytail as wiggle

    constructor {args} {

<h4><a name="can_i_delegate_to_a_method_with_additional_arguments">Can I delegate to a method with additional arguments?</a></h4>



Suppose the <code>tail</code> object has a <code>wag</code> method

that the tail should be wagged three times.  It's easily done:<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_delegate_an_option_to_a_component_object">How can I delegate an option to a component object?</a></h4>



The first question in this section (see <a href="#delegation">DELEGATION</a>) shows
one way to delegate an option 
to a component; but this pattern occurs often enough that Snit makes
it easy.  For example, every <code>tail</code> object has a
<code>-length</code> option; we want to allow the creator of a
<code>dog</code> object to set the tail's length.  We can do this:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    delegate option -length to mytail

    constructor {args} {
        install mytail using tail %AUTO% -partof $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }
}
::dog
% snit::type tail {
    option -partof
    option -length 5
}
::tail
% dog spot -length 7
::spot
% spot cget -length
7
%</pre>

This produces nearly the same result as the <code>oncget</code> and
<code>onconfigure</code> handlers shown under the first question in
this section: whenever a <code>dog</code> object's
<code>-length</code> option is set or retrieved, the underlying
<code>tail</code> object's option is set or retrieved in turn.<p>

Note that you can define an option name using the <code>option</code>
statement, or you can define it using <code>delegate</code>; you can't
do both.<p>

<h4><a name="can_i_delegate_to_an_option_with_a_different_name">Can I delegate to an option with a different name?</a></h4>



In the previous answer we delegated the <code>dog</code>'s
<code>-length</code> option down to its <code>tail</code>.  This is,
of course, wrong.  The dog has a length, and the tail has a length,
and they are different.  What we'd really like to do is give the
<code>dog</code> a <code>-taillength</code> option, but delegate it to
the <code>tail</code>'s <code>-length</code> option:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    delegate option -taillength to mytail as -length

    constructor {args} {
        set mytail [tail %AUTO% -partof $self]
        $self configurelist $args
    }
}
::dog
% snit::type tail {
    option -partof
    option -length 5
}
::tail
% dog spot -taillength 7
::spot
% spot cget -taillength
7
%</pre>

It may happen that a Snit object gets most of its behavior from one of
its components.  This often happens with
<code>snit::widgetadaptors</code>, for example, where we wish to
slightly the modify the behavior of an existing widget.  To carry on
with our <code>dog</code> example, however, suppose that we have a
<code>snit::type</code> called <code>animal</code> that implements a
variety of animal behaviors--moving, eating, sleeping, and so forth.
We want our <code>dog</code> objects to inherit these same behaviors,
while adding dog-like behaviors of its own.  Here's how we can give a
<code>dog</code> methods and options of its own while delegating all
other methods and options to its <code>animal</code> component:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    delegate option * to animal
    delegate method * to animal

    option -akc 0

    constructor {args} {
        install animal using animal %AUTO% -name $self
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    method wag {} {
        return "$self wags its tail"
    }
}
::dog
%</pre>

That's it.  A <code>dog</code> is now an <code>animal</code> which has
a <code>-akc</code> option and can <code>wag</code> its tail.<p>

Note that we don't need to specify the full list of method names or
option names which <code>animal</code> will receive.  It gets anything
<code>dog</code> doesn't recognize--and if it doesn't recognize it
either, it will simply throw an error, just as it should.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_delegate_all_but_certain_methods_or_options_to_a_component">How can I delegate all but certain methods or options to a component?</a></h4>



In the previous answer, we said that every <code>dog</code> is an
<code>animal</code> by delegating all unknown methods and options to
the <code>animal</code> component. But what if the
<code>animal</code> type has some methods or options that we'd like
to suppress?<p>

One solution is to explicitly delegate all the options and methods,
and forgo the convenience of <code>delegate method *</code> and
<code>delegate option *</code>.  But if we wish to suppress only a few
options or methods, there's an easier way:<p>

<pre>% snit::type dog {
    delegate option * to animal except -legs
    delegate method * to animal except {fly climb}

    # ...

    constructor {args} {
        install animal using animal %AUTO% -name $self -legs 4
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    # ...
}
::dog
%</pre>

Dogs have four legs, so we specify that explicitly when we create
the <code>animal</code> component, and explicitly exclude
<code>-legs</code> from the set of delegated options.  Similarly,
dogs can neither fly nor climb, so we exclude those
<code>animal</code> methods as shown.<p>

<h2><a name="widgets">WIDGETS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_snitwidget">What is a snit::widget?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::widget</code> is the Snit version of what Tcl
programmers usually call a "megawidget":  a widget-like object usually
consisting of one or more Tk widgets all contained within a Tk frame.<p>

A <code>snit::widget</code> is also a special kind of
<code>snit::type</code>.  Just about everything in this FAQ list that
relates to <code>snit::types</code> also applies to
<code>snit::widgets</code>.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_snitwidget">How do I define a snit::widget?</a></h4>



<code>snit::widgets</code> are defined using the
<code>snit::widget</code> command, just as <code>snit::types</code>
are defined by the <code>snit::type</code> command.<p>

The body of the definition can contain all of the same kinds of
statements, plus a couple of others which will be mentioned below.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_snitwidgets_differ_from_snittypes">How do snit::widgets differ from snit::types?</a></h4>



<ul>
  <li> The name of an instance of a <code>snit::type</code> can be any
       valid Tcl command name, in any namespace.  The name of an
       instance of a <code>snit::widget</code> must be a valid Tk
       widget name, and its parent widget must already exist.<p>

  <li> An instance of a <code>snit::type</code> can be destroyed by
       calling its <code>destroy</code> method.
       Instances of a <code>snit::widget</code> have no destroy
       method; use the Tk <code>destroy</code> command instead.<p>

  <li> Every instance of a <code>snit::widget</code> has one
       predefined component called its <code>hull</code> component.
       The hull is a Tk <code>frame</code> or <code>toplevel</code>
       widget; any other widgets created as 
       part of the <code>snit::widget</code> will usually be contained within
       this frame or toplevel.<p>

  <li> <code>snit::widgets</code> can have their options receive
       default values from <a href="#the_tk_option_database">the Tk option database</a>.<p>
</ul>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_hull_component">What is a hull component?</a></h4>



Snit can't create a Tk widget object; only Tk can do that.  Thus,
every instance of a <code>snit::widget</code> must be wrapped around
a genuine Tk widget; this Tk widget is called the <i>hull
component</i>.  Snit effectively piggybacks the behavior you define
(methods, options, and so forth) on top of the hull component so that
the whole thing behaves like a standard Tk widget.<p>

For <code>snit::widgets</code> the hull component must be a
Tk <code>frame</code> or <code>toplevel</code> widget; any other
widgets created as part of the <code>snit::widget</code> will
be contained within this frame or toplevel.<p>

<code>snit::widgetadaptors</code> differ from
<code>snit::widgets</code> chiefly in that any kind of widget can be
used as the hull component; see <a href="#widgetadaptors">WIDGETADAPTORS</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="how_can_i_set_the_hull_type_for_a_snitwidget">How can I set the hull type for a snit::widget?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::widget</code>'s hull component will usually be a Tk
<code>frame</code> widget; however, it may also be a
<code>toplevel</code> widget.  You can explicitly choose one or the
other by including the <code>hulltype</code> command in the widget
definition:<p>

<pre>snit::widget mytoplevel {
    hulltype toplevel

    # ...
}</pre>

If no <code>hulltype</code> command appears, the hull will be a
<code>frame</code>.<p>

<h4><a name="how_should_i_name_widgets_which_are_components_of_a_snitwidget">How should I name widgets which are components of a snit::widget?</a></h4>



Every widget, whether a genuine Tk widget or a Snit megawidget, has to
have a valid Tk window name.  When a <code>snit::widget</code> is
first created, its instance name, <code>$self</code>, is a Tk window
name; however, if the <code>snit::widget</code> is used as the hull
component by a <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> its instance name will
be changed to something else.  For this reason, every
<code>snit::widget</code> method, constructor, destructor, and so
forth is passed another implicit argument, <code>$win</code>, which is
the window name of the megawidget.  Any children must be named using
<code>$win</code> as the root.<p>

Thus, suppose you're writing a toolbar widget, a frame consisting of
a number of buttons placed side-by-side.  It might look something like
this:<p>

<pre>snit::widget toolbar {
    delegate option * to hull

    constructor {args} {
        button $win.open -text Open -command [mymethod open]
        button $win.save -text Save -command [mymethod save]

        # ....

        $self configurelist $args

    }
}</pre>

<h2><a name="widgetadaptors">WIDGETADAPTORS</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_a_snitwidgetadaptor">What is a snit::widgetadaptor?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> is a kind of
<code>snit::widget</code>.  Whereas a <code>snit::widget</code>'s hull
is automatically created and is always a Tk frame, a
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> can be based on any Tk widget--or on
any Snit megawidget, or even (with luck) on megawidgets defined using
some other package.<p>

It's called a "widget adaptor" because it allows you to take an
existing widget and customize its behavior.<p>

<h4><a name="how_do_i_define_a_snitwidgetadaptor">How do I define a snit::widgetadaptor?</a></h4>



Using the <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> command.  The definition
for a <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> looks just like that for a
<code>snit::type</code> or <code>snit::widget</code>, except that the
constructor must create and install the hull component.<p>

For example, the following code creates a read-only text widget by the simple
device of turning its "insert" and "delete" methods into no-ops.
Then, we define new methods, "ins" and "del", which get delegated
to the hull component as "insert" and "delete".  Thus, we've adapted
the text widget and given it new behavior while still leaving it
fundamentally a text widget.<p>

<pre>% ::snit::widgetadaptor rotext {

    constructor {args} {
        # Create the text widget; turn off its insert cursor
        installhull using text -insertwidth 0

        # Apply any options passed at creation time.
        $self configurelist $args
    }

    # Disable the text widget's insert and delete methods, to
    # make this readonly.
    method insert {args} {}
    method delete {args} {}

    # Enable ins and del as synonyms, so the program can insert and
    # delete.
    delegate method ins to hull as insert
    delegate method del to hull as delete
    
    # Pass all other methods and options to the real text widget, so
    # that the remaining behavior is as expected.
    delegate method * to hull
    delegate option * to hull
}
::rotext
%</pre>

The most important part is in the constructor.  Whereas
<code>snit::widget</code> creates the hull for you,
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> cannot--it doesn't know what kind of
widget you want.  So the first thing the constructor does is create
the hull component (a Tk text widget in this case), and then installs
it using the <code>installhull</code> command.<p>

<b>Note:</b> There is no instance command until you create one by
installing a hull component.  Any attempt to pass methods to $self
prior to calling <code>installhull</code> will fail.<p>

<h4><a name="can_i_adapt_a_widget_created_by_someone_else">Can I adapt a widget created by someone else?</a></h4>



Yes.<p>

At times, it can be convenient to adapt a widget created by another
party.  For example, the Bwidget <code>PagesManager</code> widget
manages a set of <code>frame</code> widgets, only one of which is
visible at a time.  The application chooses which <code>frame</code>
is visible.  These <code>frames</code> are created by the
<code>PagesManager</code> itself, using its <code>add</code>
method.<p>

In a case like this, the Tk widget will already exist when the
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> is created.  Snit provides an
alternate form of the <code>installhull</code> command for this purpose:<p>

<pre>snit::widgetadaptor pageadaptor {
    constructor {args} {
        # The widget already exists; just install it.
        installhull $win

        # ...
    }
}</pre>

<h2><a name="the_tk_option_database">THE TK OPTION DATABASE</a></h2>

<h4><a name="what_is_the_tk_option_database">What is the Tk option database?</a></h4>



The Tk option database is a database of default option values
maintained by Tk itself; every Tk application has one.  The concept of
the option database derives from something called the X Windows
resource database; however, the option database is available in every
Tk implementation, including those which do not use the X Windows
system (e.g., Microsoft Windows).<p>

Full details about the Tk option database are beyond the scope of
this document; both <i>Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk</i> by
Welch, Jones, and Hobbs, and <i>Effective Tcl/Tk Programming</i> by
Harrison and McClennan., have good introductions to it.<p>

Snit is implemented so that most of the time it will simply do the
right thing with respect to the option database, provided that the
widget developer does the right thing by Snit.  The body of this
section goes into great deal about what Snit requires.  The following
is a brief statement of the requirements, for reference.<p>

<ul>
  <li> If the widget's default widget class is not what is desired, set it
       explicitly using the <code>widgetclass</code> statement in the
       widget definition.<p>

  <li> When defining or delegating options, specify the resource and
       class names explicitly when necessary.<p>

  <li> Use the <code>installhull using</code> command to create
       and install the hull for <code>snit::widgetadaptors</code>.<p>

  <li> Use the <code>install</code> command to create and install all
       other components.<p>
</ul>

The interaction of Tk widgets with the option database is a complex
thing; the interaction of Snit with the option database is even more
so, and repays attention to detail.<p>

<h4><a name="do_snittypes_use_the_tk_option_database">Do snit::types use the Tk option database?</a></h4>



No, they don't; querying the option database requires a Tk window
name, and snit::types don't have one.<p>

Only <code>snit::widgets</code> and <code>snit::widgetadaptors</code>
query the option database.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_my_snitwidgets_widget_class">What is my snit::widget's widget class?</a></h4>



Every Tk widget has a "widget class": a name that is used when adding option
settings to the database.  For Tk widgets, the widget class is the
same as the widget command name with an initial capital.  For
example, the widget class of the Tk <code>button</code> widget is
"Button".<p>

Similarly, the widget class of a <code>snit::widget</code> defaults
to the unqualified type name with the first letter capitalized.  For
example, the widget class of<p>

<pre>snit::widget ::mylibrary::scrolledText { ... }</pre>

is "ScrolledText".<p>

The widget class can also be set explicitly using
the <code>widgetclass</code> statement within the
<code>snit::widget</code> definition:<p>

<pre>snit::widget ::mylibrary::scrolledText {
    widgetclass Text

    # ...
}</pre>

The above definition says that a <code>scrolledText</code> megawidget
has the same widget class as an ordinary <code>text</code> widget.
This might or might not be a good idea, depending on how the rest of
the megawidget is defined, and how its options are delegated.<p>

<h4><a name="what_is_my_snitwidgetadaptors_widget_class">What is my snit::widgetadaptor's widget class?</a></h4>



The widget class of a <code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> is just the
widget class of its hull widget; Snit has no control over this.<p>

Note that the widget class can be changed only for <code>frame</code> and
<code>toplevel</code> widgets, which is why these are the valid hull
types for <code>snit::widgets</code>.<p>

Try to use <code>snit::widgetadaptors</code> only to make small
modifications to another widget's behavior.  Then, it will usually
not make sense to change the widget's widget class anyway.<p>

<h4><a name="what_are_option_resource_and_class_names">What are option resource and class names?</a></h4>



Every Tk widget option has three names: the option name, the
resource name, and the class name.  The option name begins with a
hyphen and is all lowercase; it's used when creating widgets, and with the
<code>configure</code> and <code>cget</code> commands.<p>

The resource and class names are used to initialize option
default values by querying the option database.
The resource name is usually just the option
name minus the hyphen, but may contain uppercase letters at word
boundaries; the class name is usually just the resource
name with an initial capital, but not always.  For example, here are
the option, resource, and class names for several Tk <code>text</code>
widget options:<p>

<pre>
-background         background         Background 
-borderwidth        borderWidth        BorderWidth 
-insertborderwidth  insertBorderWidth  BorderWidth 
-padx               padX               Pad 
</pre>

As is easily seen, sometimes the resource and class names can be
inferred from the option name, but not always.<p>

<h4><a name="what_are_the_resource_and_class_names_for_my_megawidgets_options">What are the resource and class names for my megawidget's options?</a></h4>



For options implicitly delegated to a component using <code>delegate
option *</code>, the resource and class names will be exactly those
defined by the component.  The <code>configure</code> method returns
these names, along with the option's default and current values:<p>

<pre>% snit::widget mytext {
    delegate option * to text

    constructor {args} {
        install text using text .text
        # ...
    }

    # ...
}
::mytext
% mytext .text
.text
% .text configure -padx
-padx padX Pad 1 1
%</pre>

For all other options (whether locally defined or explicitly
delegated), the resource and class names can be defined explicitly,
or they can be allowed to have default values.<p>

By default, the resource name is just the option name minus the
hyphen; the the class name is just the option name with an initial
capital letter.  For example, suppose we explicitly delegate "-padx":<p>

<pre>% snit::widget mytext {
    option -myvalue 5

    delegate option -padx to text
    delegate option * to text

    constructor {args} {
        install text using text .text
        # ...
    }

    # ...
}
::mytext
% mytext .text
.text
% .text configure -mytext
-mytext mytext Mytext 5 5
% .text configure -padx
-padx padx Padx 1 1
%</pre>

Here the resource and class names are chosen using the default
rules.  Often these rules are sufficient, but in the case of "-padx" we'd most
likely prefer that the option's resource and class names are the same
as for the built-in Tk widgets.  This is easily done:<p>

<pre>% snit::widget mytext {
    delegate option {-padx padX Pad} to text

    # ...
}
::mytext
% mytext .text
.text
% .text configure -padx
-padx padX Pad 1 1
%</pre>

<h4><a name="how_does_snit_initialize_my_megawidgets_locallydefined_options">How does Snit initialize my megawidget's locally-defined options?</a></h4>



The option database is queried for each of the megawidget's locally-defined
options, using the option's resource and class name.  If the result
isn't "", then it replaces the default value given in widget
definition.  In either case, the default can be overriden by the
caller.  For example,<p>

<pre>option add *Mywidget.texture pebbled

snit::widget mywidget {
     option -texture smooth
     # ...
}

mywidget .mywidget -texture greasy</pre>

Here, "-texture" would normally default to "smooth", but because of
the entry added to the option database it defaults to "pebbled".
However, the caller has explicitly overridden the default, and so the
new widget will be "greasy".<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_snit_initialize_delegated_options">How does Snit initialize delegated options?</a></h4>



That depends on whether the options are delegated to the hull, or to
some other component.<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_snit_initialize_options_delegated_to_the_hull">How does Snit initialize options delegated to the hull?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::widget</code>'s hull is a widget, and given that its
class has been set it is expected to query the option database for
itself.  The only exception concerns options that are delegated to it
with a different name.  Consider the following code:<p>

<pre>option add *Mywidget.borderWidth 5
option add *Mywidget.relief sunken
option add *Mywidget.hullbackground red
option add *Mywidget.background green

snit::widget mywidget {
    delegate option -borderwidth to hull
    delegate option -hullbackground to hull as -background
    delegate option * to hull
    # ...
}

mywidget .mywidget

set A [.mywidget cget -relief]
set B [.mywidget cget -hullbackground]
set C [.mywidget cget -background]
set D [.mywidget cget -borderwidth]</pre>

The question is, what are the values of variables A, B, C and D?<p>

The value of A is "sunken".  The hull is a Tk frame which has been
given the widget class "Mywidget"; it will automatically query the
option database and pick up this value.  Since the -relief option
is implicitly delegated to the hull, Snit takes no action.<p>

The value of B is "red".  The hull will automatically pick up the
value "green" for its -background option, just as it picked up the
-relief value.  However, Snit knows that -hullbackground is mapped
to the hull's  -background option; hence, it queries the option
database for -hullbackground and gets "red" and updates the hull
accordingly.<p>

The value of C is also "red", because -background is implicitly
delegated to the hull; thus, retrieving it is the same as retrieving
-hullbackground.  Note that this case is unusual; the -background
option should probably have been excluded using the delegate
statement's "except" clause, or (more likely) delegated to some other
component.<p>

The value of D is "5", but not for the reason you think.  Note that
as it is defined above, the resource name for -borderwidth defaults
to "borderwidth", whereas the option database entry is "borderWidth",
in accordance with the standard Tk naming for this option.
As with -relief, the hull picks up its own "-borderwidth" option
before Snit does anything.  Because the option is delegated under its
own name, Snit assumes that the correct thing has happened, and
doesn't worry about it any further.  To avoid confusion, the
-borderwidth option should have been delegated like this:<p>

<pre>    delegate option {-borderwidth borderWidth BorderWidth} to hull</pre>

For <code>snit::widgetadaptors</code>, the case is somewhat altered.
Widget adaptors retain the widget class of their hull, and the
hull is not created automatically by Snit.  Instead, the
<code>snit::widgetadaptor</code> must call
<code>installhull</code> in its
constructor.  The normal way to do this is as follows:<p>

<pre>
snit::widgetadaptor mywidget {
    # ...
    constructor {args} {
        # ...
        installhull using text -foreground white
        #
    }
    #...
}
</pre>

In this case, the <code>installhull</code>
command will create the hull using a command like this:<p>

<pre>
    set hull [text $win -foreground white]
</pre>

The hull is a <code>text</code> widget, so its widget class
is "Text".  Just as with <code>snit::widget</code> hulls,
Snit assumes that it will pick up all of its normal option values
automatically, without help from Snit.  Options delegated from a
different name are initialized from the option database in the same
way as described above.<p>

In earlier versions of Snit, <code>snit::widgetadaptors</code> were
expected to call <code>installhull</code> like this:<p>

<pre>    installhull [text $win -foreground white]</pre>

This form still works--but Snit will not query the option database
as described above.<p>

<h4><a name="how_does_snit_initialize_options_delegated_to_other_components">How does Snit initialize options delegated to other components?</a></h4>



For hull components, Snit assumes that Tk will do most of the work
automatically.  Hull components are somewhat more complicated,
because they are matched against the option database twice.<p>

A component widget remains a widget still, and is therefore
initialized from the option database in the usual way.  A
<code>text</code> widget remains a <code>text</code> widget whether
it is a component of a megawidget or not, and will be created as such.<p>

But then, the option database is queried for all options delegated
to the component, and the component is initialized
accordingly--provided that the <code>install</code>
command is used to create it.<p>

Before option database support was added to Snit, the usual way to
create a component was to simply create it in the constructor and
assign its command name to the component variable:<p>

<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {
    delegate option -background to myComp

    constructor {args} {
        set myComp [text $win.text -foreground black]
    }
}
</pre>

The drawback of this method is that Snit has no opportunity to
initialize the component properly.  Hence, the following approach is
now used:<p>

<pre>
snit::widget mywidget {
    delegate option -background to myComp

    constructor {args} {
        install myComp using text $win.text -foreground black
    }
}
</pre>

The <code>install</code> command does the
following:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Builds a list of the options explicitly included in the
       <code>install</code> command--in this
       case, -foreground.<p>
       
  <li> Queries the option database for all options delegated
       explicitly to the named component.<p>

  <li> Creates the component using the specified command, after
       inserting into it a list of options and values read from the
       option database.  Thus, the explicitly include options
       (-foreground) will override anything read from the option
       database.<p>

  <li> If the widget definition implicitly delegated options to the
       component using "delegate option *", then Snit calls the newly
       created component's <code>configure</code> method to receive a
       list of all of the component's options.  From this Snit builds
       a list of options implicitly delegated to the component which
       were not explicitly included in the
       <code>install</code> command.  For all
       such options, Snit queries the option database and configures
       the component accordingly.<p>
</ul>

You don't really need to know all of this; just use
<code>install</code> to install your components, and Snit will try to
do the right thing.<p>

<h4><a name="what_happens_if_i_install_a_nonwidget_as_a_component_of_widget">What happens if I install a non-widget as a component of widget?</a></h4>



A <code>snit::type</code> never queries the option database.
However, a <code>snit::widget</code> can have non-widget
components.  And if options are delegated to those components, and if
the <code>install</code> command is used to
install those components, then they will be initialized from the
option database just as widget components are.<p>

However, when used within a megawidget, <code>install</code> assumes
that the created component uses a reasonably standard widget-like
