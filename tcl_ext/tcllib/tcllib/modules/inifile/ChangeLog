	* inifile.test: Fixed [Tcllib SF Bug 899204] by (a) rewriting all
	  tests to be completely independent of each other and (b)
	  changing the mode when opening the test file to 'r'. It should
	  be noted that the write facilities of the module are not covered
	  by the testsuite. That is unfortunate.

	* inifile.test: It was easier to make this package useable for Tcl
	* ini.tcl:      8.2 than excluding it from test for versions of Tcl
	* ini.man:      before 8.4. So that was done.

	* ini.tcl: Got a rewritten system from Aaron.
	* ini.man: Updated the documentation.

	* infile.test: New testsuite for module.
	* test.ini:

	* ini.tcl: Added a comment header for RCS id, copyright notices,
	  etc. Slight reformatting of the code. Slight code changes to
	  make 'procheck' complain less (proper import of variables into
	  the scope).

	  Documented possible bug.
