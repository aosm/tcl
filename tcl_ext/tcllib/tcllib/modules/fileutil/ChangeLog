	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6.1 ========================
	* 

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Rel. engineering. Updated version number 
	* fileutil.man: of fileutil to reflect its changes, to 1.6.1.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Cleaning up after Aaron. Updated the test
	  filetype-1.12 to look for the extended return value of fileType
	  when applied to jpeg images. The last checkin changed this, but
	  the test was not updated as well, most likely not even
	  run. Found and corrected during release preparation and testing.

2004-05-11  Aaron Faupell <afaupell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: updated the jpeg test to recognize exif format

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6 ========================
	* 

2004-02-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: The tempdir tests used advanced test syntax not
	  available before 8.4 (IIRC). Not useable for 8.2. Ditto the lot of
	  the install tests also used 8.3 and 8.4 features. Straightened
	  the bad syntax out (killed the tests), and added proper
	  constraints to the tests.

	* fileutil.tcl: Ooops. fileutil is certified for usage with Tcl
	  8.2, there is no [file normalize] before 8.4. Made the usage
	  (See 2004-02-03) conditional.

2004-02-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Modified the tests a bit to use glob characters
	  in file names to check that the code is robust against that too.

	  See http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=29491

2004-02-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (tempdir, tempfile): Now [file normalize]'ing the
	  results of these two commands. More windows friendly.

2004-01-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::find): Fixed bug in handling a single
	  file as base directory: The initial list was not set up as a
	  list, and the test results (see below) were not listified either
	  for these cases. That broke down for paths containing
	  spaces. Also fixed: Neither the windows nor the pre-8.4 version
	  of the command had been modified to deal with a single file.
	  Oversight from the change @ 2003-10-22 by David N. Welton
	  <davidw@dedasys.com>.

	  Regularized a number of error returns.

	* fileutil.test: Changed testsuite to use files and directories
	  containing spaces in their names. A number of tests
	  failed. Modified the tempdir tests to better exclude and
	  manipulate the environment to enforce the wanted result.

2004-01-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileType): The check for an attached metakit
	  database left a channel on the tested file open. This causes the
	  application to leak channels, and on windows the file is also
	  locked against deletion. Fixed.

2003-11-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Added new test and docs for change below.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::cat): Make cat accept multiple files
	(bug [830075]).

2003-10-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Better formatting of the new docs.

2003-10-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Documented 'fileutil::tempdir' algorithm.

2003-10-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Updated documentation, added description of
	  'fileutil::tempdir'.

2003-10-23  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.test (tempdir): Added a few very simple tests for
	  tempdir under Unix.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::tempdir): Added tempdir
	  implementation.
	  (::fileutil::tempfile): Use new tempdir command.

2003-10-22  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::find): Change Unix version of find
	  command to accept a file (as opposed to a directory) as an
	  argument.  This reflects the behavior of the Unix find
	  command. This change also needs to be added to the windows
	  version, but should probably be done by someone who can test it
	  on that platform.
	  (::fileutil::install): -m option only works on Unix, as far as I
	  know.
	  (::fileutil::install): Make sure correct thing is chmod'ed.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for find to check that it works ok
	  with a single file as an argument.  Also, error out if initial
	  file does not correspond to 'isfile' or 'isdirectory'.

2003-09-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::fileType): Fixed the SourceForge Tcllib
	  bug [795585]. We are now allowing whitespace between the #! and
	  path of the script interpreter. Extended to identify metakit
	  databases, also when attached to another file.

	  (tempfile): Added 'global env', access to 'env' was bad, causing
	  malfunction on windows.

2003-08-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Fixed a bad call of [cmd] in the documentation of
	  the new install command. Always use 'sak validate moldule' to
	  validate the whole module, or 'sak text module' when wishing to
	  validate only the documentation.

2003-08-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (find): The fix for SF tcllib bug [647974]
	  introduced a tcl command new to tcl 8.4. This command is
	  [file system]. Changing the code to exclude dev/inode checking
	  only for 8.4 and above. For versions of Tcl below 8.4. the fix
	  is not required as they do not have virtual filesystem
	  support. This fixes SF tcllib bug [784157].

2003-08-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Added documentation for the new 'install' command.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::install): Added 'install' command,
	which is similar in functionality to the Unix install command - it
	is basically file copy with some additional features.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for 'install' fileutil command.

2003-07-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.5.1 as this is a bug fix. Any bug fixes and
	  more minor changes coming in the future do not have to bump the
	  version number anymore until the next release. Only a major
	  change warrants another bump before the release.

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed SF tcllib bug [647974]. We now ignore
	  device/inode information if the current path is in a virtual
	  filesystem. We also assume now that VFS's do not support links,
	  thus also obviating the need for the data, circles cannot occur.

2003-05-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::tempfile): Braced [expr].

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-05-01  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl:   The touch command cannot be implemented in Tcl
	* fileutil.test:  versions < 8.3 so do not define the command.
	* fileutil.man:   Noted in documentation and skipped tests.

2003-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added command [tempfile]. Was part of tcllib patch
	  611595, but has a better place here.

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  Set version of the package to to 1.5.

2003-04-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test (fileutil): Fixed tcllib SF bug #714214 reported
	  by Pat Thoyts, by working around the 'makeFile' command provided
	  with tcltest. It seems to have issues when doing binary data.

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::touch): Applied patch #688965 provided
	  by Glenn Jackman <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net>. This patch
	  provides a better message when asking the [fileutil::touch]
	  command for help.

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed bug #707009, reported by Helmut Giese
	  <hgiese@users.sourceforge.net>, also updated the documentation
	  and the testsuite.

2003-01-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fileType): Use 'string match' instead
	  of regexp.  Require Tcl 8.2.

2003-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: More semantic markup, less visual one.

2002-10-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl:
	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.test: Accepted enhanced format detection by Philip
	  Ehrens <pehrens@ligo.caltech.edu>.

2002-05-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (cat): Fixed bug #556504, reported by Michael
	  A. Cleverly <cleverly@users.sourceforge.net>. The fix was
	  provided by Michael too. The problem was reading files which are
	  reported as size 0, but actually have content, just dynamically
	  generated (Linux /proc is an example of an fs containing such
	  files).

2002-05-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Documented the two new commands (stripN,
	  stripPwd).

	* fileutil.tcl: Made up my mind about SF Bug #462015. The proposed
	  interface change to [find] is rejected to keep the interface of
	  the library procedure simple and without hidden surprises =
	  KISS. Added a command [stripPwd] instead which can be used by
	  the caller of [find] to make the returned paths relative to the
	  current working directory. Also added [stripN] to strip a fixed
	  number of elements from the beginning of a path.

2002-04-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Added doctools manpage.
	* fileutils.n: Updated to reflect change of version.

2002-03-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Bumped version to 1.4
	
	* fileutil.n:
	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added fileType command posted to comp.lang.tcl by
	  Phil Ehrens, with some minor modifications.

2002-01-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.3

2001-12-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Restricted tests 2.2 and 2.3 to the directory
	  structure created for the test and not the whole directory the
	  test is run in. Bugfix for item #486572.

2001-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.n:
	* fileutil.tcl: Applied patch #477805 by Glenn Jackman
	  <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net> implementing the unix 'touch'
	  command. Contains documentation and testsuite for the new
	  command too.

2001-09-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Restricted export list to public API.
	  [456255]. Patch by Hemang Lavana
	  <hemanglavana@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-08-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All of the changes below are related to tcllib Patch [449531] by
	  Anselm Lingnau <lingnau@users.sourceforge.net>. Instead of
	  taking in the proposed highlevel 'fileinput' I added some of the
	  more low-level commands from Tclx which can be used to
	  create/compose 'fileinput'.

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Moved version of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for the new commands. Moved version
	  of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.n: Added documentation of the new commands. Moved
	  version of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.tcl (findByPattern, foreachLine): New commands, modeled
	  after TclX's 'recursive_glob' and 'for_file'. Moved version of
	  fileutil to 1.2.

2001-07-31  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.n: Added manpage documenting the commands. tcllib Bug
	  [446584].

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink.

2001-03-20  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: [Bug #410104, Patch #410106]
	  New implementation of ::fileutil::find for unixoid OSs using
	  stat and device/inode configuration to detect and break circular
	  softlink structures. This implementation also skips un'stat'able
	  files and directories.

	* fileutil.test: Added fileutil-1.4 testing the circle breaker
	  (only under unix).

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added cat function, duplicates standard UNIX "cat"
	  utility.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* fileutil.test: Collected tests into one file; adapted tests for
	  use in/out of tcllib test framework.
