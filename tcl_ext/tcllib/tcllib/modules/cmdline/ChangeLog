2004-02-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* typedCmdline.test: Fixed the problems of the testsuite with
	* cmdline.test:      Tcl 8.5. It relied on the order of data
	                     returned by [array get].

2003-08-19  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* cmdline.man: Added an example.  Feel free to change/improve it,
	  but this package really needed one to show the standard usage
	  pattern.

2003-08-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Bumped version information to 1.2.2 for the bugfix.

2003-08-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmdline.tcl (getfiles): Using the [string map] fix still had
	  problems, when mixing back- and forward slashes. Now using [file
	  join] on the pattern. This removed all problems with the
	  quoting. I.e. this operation pseudo-normalizes the path. Got the
	  trick from JeffH.

2003-08-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* cmdline.test: Added a test for the backslash quoting behaviour.

	* cmdline.tcl (getfiles): Corrected a bogus attempt to quote
	  backslashes in file patterns on the windows platform.

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	* 

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* typedCmdline.tcl: Fixed bug #614591. See also last entry, this
	  file was forgotten.

2003-04-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl:
	* cmdline.tcl:
	* cmdline.man: Fixed bug #648679. Fixed bug #614591. Set version
	  of the package to to 1.2.1

	* urn-scheme.tcl: Fixed bug #614591. Set version
	  of the package to to 1.2.1

2003-02-23  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* cmdline.tcl (cmdline::getfiles): Use string map instead of
	regsub.

2002-08-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* typeCmdline.tcl: Updated 'info exist' to 'info exists'.

2002-04-24  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Applied patch #540313 on behalf of Melissa Chawla
	  <melissachawla@yahoo.com> and Don Porter
	  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>.

	  * cmdline.test: 
	  * cmdline.tcl: Added getKnownOpt and getKnownOptions procedures
	    to the API.  The procedures offer a way for arguments that are
	    not in the optionList to be ignored.  This way, you can have
	    two independant locations in your application where
	    commandline arguments are parsed.  I bumped the package
	    version to 1.2.

	* cmdline.man: Updated documentation.

2002-04-14  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* cmdline.man: Added doctools manpage.

2001-10-16  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Version up to 1.1.1

2001-10-12  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* cmdline.tcl: Corrected the inline documentation to reflect what
	  is actually happening. Problem reported by Glenn Jackman
	  <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net>, Item #46650.

2001-07-31  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* cmdline.n: Added manpage [446584].

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* typedCmdline.tcl:
	* cmdline.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink.

2000-05-03  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* cmdline.tcl: Changed cmdline::getopt to set boolean arguments to
	0 or 1 explicitly.  Previously it just set the value to "" if it
	was present, or did nothing.  This vfixes the -verbose command
	line bug in connect.

2000-04-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* typedCmdline.test: Changed sourcing bits at start of file to
	work better with updated file dependancies.

	* typedCmdline.tcl: Removed "package provide"; that should occur
	only in one file per package.  Reformatted function headers to
	comply with Tcl coding standard.  Renamed "cmdline::lsearch" to
	"cmdline::prefixSearch" to avoid confusion, and removed code thus
	made obsolete.

	* cmdline.tcl: Added call to source typedCmdline.tcl

2000-04-04  Ross Mohn  <rpmohn@panix.com>

	* typedCmdline.tcl: Added typed versions of getopt, getoptions,
	and usage. Types supported are all character classes available
	for the Tcl "string in" command.

	* typedCmdline.test: Added tests for typed procedures.

	* cmdline.tcl: Corrected some documentation errors and omissions.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* cmdline.test: Adapted tests to work with tcllib test framework.

1999-10-29  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* cmdline.tcl: Fixed bug where options that contained regexp
	special characters would cause an error.  Cleaned up lots of
	messy code.  Added test suite.
