		Memory Channels in Tcl
		(Version 2.2.0 / JUN-03-2004)

	Andreas Kupries	(andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net)

This directory contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl
implementing memory channels, i.e. channels storing the data
placed into them in memory, not on disk.


BACKGROUND

Tcl stands for the Tool Command Language, a freely distributable,
embeddable scripting language package.  Tk is an freely distributable X
windows interface toolkit and widget library implemented as a collection of
new commands added to Tcl.

Memchan 2.2.0 is developed for Tcl 8.0 or higher.  It is a Tcl
extension, Tk is not required.

This distribution contains the source code for Memchan + (very simple)
documentation describing the new command.
Memchan should be available by anonymous ftp from ftp.neosoft.com soon.

REMARKS

This extension was developed on my private computer, a PC running
Linux 1.2.13 (gcc 2.7.2), now 2.0.29, gcc 2.7.2.3. If you have
problems compiling on a particular architecture please send me
your solutions so that I am able to integrate them into the base.
