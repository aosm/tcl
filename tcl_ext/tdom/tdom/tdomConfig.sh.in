# tdomConfig.sh --
# 
# This shell script (for Bourne sh and alike) is generated 
# automatically by tDOM configure script. It will create 
# shell variables for some of the configuration options 
# discovered by the configure. This script is intended to be
# sourced by the configure scripts for tDOM extensions so 
# that they don't have to figure this all out for themselves.
# This file does not duplicate information already provided
# by tclConfig.sh, so you may need to use that file in addition
# to this one. To be able to locate this file easily, extensions
# might want to include the tdom.m4 file in their configure
# scripts and use the TDOM_PATH_CONFIG and TDOM_LOAD_CONFIG.
#
# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.
