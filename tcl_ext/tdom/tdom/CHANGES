        Added the up to now missing implementation of expatObj method
        cget. Thanks goes to Harry Moreau for his contribution.

2003-04-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added domDoc method toXSLTcmd, which converts the domDoc to an
        XSLTcmd. This has no advantage over the current method in
        one-shot cases (transformation of one XML document) but
        improves the speed of batch processing of several XML
        documents or server applications. The implementation was
        already included in the 0.7.7 release, only the documentation
        was not included in that release.

        Added option -paramentityparsing to the dom parse method.        

--- Release 0.7.7, 25. Mar. 2003 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

--- Release 0.7.6, 24. Mar. 2003 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2003-03-19  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added option -useForeignDTD to dom parse and expat. Added
        domNode method 'precedes', to compare the relative order of
        two nodes out of the same document.

2003-02-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added posteriori (DOM) validation capabilities. See the tnc
        man page for details.

2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Update to expat 1.95.6.    

2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added 'systemId' and 'publicId' methods to the domDoc
        commands. Added flag -doctypeDeclaration to the asXML and
        asHTML methods of the domDoc commands.     

2003-01-29  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Changed the escaping while serializing XML data: in the past
        """ and "'" was escaped, now it isn't anymore. There isn't a
        clear rule (to the best of my knowledge) in any of the related
        specs about this, but now we do things almost along the lines,
        as saxon (which I regard as the currently most 'rule-setting'
        xslt processor) does it. In theory (from an XML viewpoint)
        this should not make a difference, but if somebody postprocess
        some tDOM output with other tools, there is a small risk, that
        things (slightly) breaks, therefor:
        *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2002-12-28  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        The xslt method now understands also the options
          -ignoreUndeclaredParameters and -xsltmessagecmd.

--- Release 0.7.5, 27. Nov. 2002 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2002-10-01  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	The library file lib/tdomhtml.tcl is now moved to a separate
	package in "extensions" directory. This is a simple, yet very
	"clever" HTML generator, using advanced tdom HTML capabilities.
 	To use, please change to "extensions/tdomhtml" directory and 
	invoke "configure" followed by "make", followed by "make install".
        Be sure, however, to build and install the tdom package first.
