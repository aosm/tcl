This is the README file for the Windows version of the 'Tcl-Trf' package.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile Trf for Windows, you need the following items:

	Trf 2.1.3 Source Distribution
	Tcl 7.6, 8.0+ Source distribution
	A version of 'patch' running under Windows.

	Visual C++ 2.x/4.x/5.x


First you have to patch and recompile your Tcl distribution. Please read
paragraph 1 of 'doc/INSTALL' on how to do this.


In the "win" subdirectory of the source release, you will find two
files called "makefile.bc" and "makefile.vc".  These are the makefiles
for the Borland and Visual C++ compilers respectively.  You should
copy the appropriate one to "makefile" and update the paths at the
top of the file to reflect your system configuration.  Now you can use
"make" (or "nmake" for VC++) to build the tcl libraries and the tclsh
executable.
