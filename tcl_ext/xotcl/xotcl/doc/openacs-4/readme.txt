This is the OpenACS Community System.

OpenACS (Open ArsDigita Community System) is an advanced toolkit for
building scalable, community-oriented web applications.

The original ACS, which formed the foundation of OpenACS is described
in http://photo.net/wtr/thebook/community.html

The original ACS was Copyright (C) 1995-2000 ArsDigita Corporation
and, in some cases, individual authors.

OpenACS is a community created and supported software system, visit
http://openacs.org for more information. 

The major change in OpenACS 4.x is its database-independence; it can
use either PostgreSQL (7.1 or later) or Oracle (8.1.6 or later).
