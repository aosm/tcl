Tclresource 1.0
===============

This is the Tclresource extension implementing the  [resource]  command  in
Tcl. System MacOSX 10.2 or greater is  required.  This  extension  is  only
useful on Macintosh platforms.

The Tclresource1.1 folder should be installed on your system in /Library/Tcl
or ~/Library/Tcl or any folder contained in your auto_path variable. If you
use it with AlphaX (version 8.0b11 or greater), you can also install it  in
the Tclextensions folder at the same level as the application and it will be
loaded automatically by AlphaX at startup.

Please read the documentation about the command in the Help file
    TclResourceHelp.html

To load the extension in a Tcl script, just use the following instruction:
    package require resource
