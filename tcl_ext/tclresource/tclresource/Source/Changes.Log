Changes Log for the Tclresource extension
=========================================

The [resource] command was originally defined as a built-in command of  Tcl
on MacOS 7/8/9. The original code can  be  found  in  the  Tcl  sources  in
/tcl/mac/tclMacResource.c. Tclresource is  backwards  compatible  with  the
original command. Version 1.0 can be considered strictly as a port of  this
command to OSX (with minor modifications reflecting OSX idiosyncrasies:  no
ROM resource map etc.). Versions 1.1 and greater widely enhance the  syntax
of the [resource] command but will always remain backwards compatible  with
the original command.

This is an Open Source project. The source code for this extension can be 
found on the SourceForge site at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tclresource>
Tclresource binary releases are available at
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93101> or on my web 
page at <http://webperso.easyconnect.fr/bdesgraupes/tcl.html>
You can browse the cvs repository online at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tclresource>

================================================================================

================================================================================
€ fix for [resource list] crashing bug: ReleaseResource should not 
  be called if resource is already in memory. This occured when 
  calling [resource list] with no resourceRef i-e on all resource maps.
  This bug was already in the original [resource] command under OS8/9 !

€ first release of the old [resource] command as a loadable extension for 
OSX. No additional features: just the plain old [resource] as defined as a 
built-in command in OS9 and earlier.
