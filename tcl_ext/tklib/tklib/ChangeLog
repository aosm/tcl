	* Reworked the entire build system to use the same framework as
	  tcllib does. IOW tklib now uses a swiss army knife tool
	  (sak.tcl, with all attendant files), and configure/Makefile are
	  based on that. Generation of distributions, and installer now
	  also work in the same way as for tcllib.

	* Replaced existing nroff documentation with doctools manpages,
	  and wrote doctools manpages for the modules which had none. All
	  (four) modules now have documentation.
