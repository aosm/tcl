	* pkgIndex.tcl: style::as is version 1.2
	* as.tcl: much more elaborate version of style::as that is meant
	to change style across platforms.  This auto-inits, but allows for
	reinitialization with higher priority (needed for CDE/KDE/...).

	* lobster.tcl: Added internal padding to Labelframe.  They look
	better if they have some empty space in them.  Added Scrollbar
	things from as.tcl, which make the scrollbars nicer by narrowing
	them a bit.
