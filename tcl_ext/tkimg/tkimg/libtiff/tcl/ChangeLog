	* tifftclDeclsMask.h: 
	* tifftclDeclsUnmask.h: Added the appropriate lines to handle the
	  reactivated vararg functions, and the newly exported functions.

	* tifftcl.decls: A number of vararg functions were commented
	  out. Reactivated them now. Also added definitions found in
	  'tif_predic.h', 'tif_dir.h', and 'tiffiop.h'. Regenerated the
	  stub support files.

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Extended 'genStubs.tcl'. The application is
	  now able to handle vararg declarations with more than one
	  argument. When it encounters such declarations it emits code
	  which is useable only if <stdarg.h> is present and used by the
	  compiler. It also emits C preprocessor definitions checking this
	  at compile time, using the NO_STDARG macro used 'tcl.h'.

	* Start of logging.

	* libtiff/tcl/: New directory, packaging of support library for
	  tcl.
