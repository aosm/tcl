/*
 * These macros are used to control whether functions are being declared for
 * import or export in Windows,
 * They map to no-op declarations on non-Windows systems.
 * Assumes that tcl.h defines DLLEXPORT & DLLIMPORT correctly.
 * The default build on windows is for a DLL, which causes the DLLIMPORT
 * and DLLEXPORT macros to be nonempty. To build a static library, the
 * macro STATIC_BUILD should be defined before the inclusion of tcl.h
 *
 * If a function is being declared while it is being built
 * to be included in a shared library, then it should have the DLLEXPORT
 * storage class.  If is being declared for use by a module that is going to
 * link against the shared library, then it should have the DLLIMPORT storage
 * class.  If the symbol is beind declared for a static build or for use from a
 * stub library, then the storage class should be empty.
 *
 * The convention is that a macro called BUILD_xxxx, where xxxx is the
 * name of a library we are building, is set on the compile line for sources
 * that are to be placed in the library.  When this macro is set, the
 * storage class will be set to DLLEXPORT.  At the end of the header file, the
 * storage class will be reset to DLLIMPORt.
