- We do no install the section 3 man pages without the Tcl_
prefix. Usually Tcl installs a man page Foo and Foo.3 and makes a hard
link to it at Tcl_Foo.3.  Several of these names, however, conflict
with other nam pages, particularly when on case-insensitive file
systems like HFS+.

- We no longer install the section n man pages.  There is no section n
in BSD.  We should probably figure out where these should go.
